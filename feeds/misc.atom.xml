&lt;p&gt;In this post, I will be scraping the works of three famous poets--William Wordsworth, John Milton, and Thomas Hardy--and running them through a natural language processing algorithm with the goal of identifying the author by feeding a poem into said algorithm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's begin by importing the requisite packages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;gazpacho&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Soup&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;nltk.corpus&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stopwords&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;nltk.stem.porter&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PorterStemmer&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sklearn.model_selection&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;train_test_split&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be sourcing my corpus data from the Poetry Foundation website using Gazpacho--a web scraping library developed by &lt;a href="https://github.com/maxhumber"&gt;Max Humber&lt;/a&gt;. The scraping process is fairly simple, as there aren't many inconsistencies in the HTML code. I'll be scraping the individual poem URL for each poem on each poet's page, and adding it to a URL list. This list will then be fed into a custom scraping function in order to scrape a list of poems from each author.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poets/william-wordsworth&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;soup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;poems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ul&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;class&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;o-graphBlocks o-graphBlocks_matrix o-graphBlocks_3up@small o-graphBlocks_4up@medium o-graphBlocks_matrix_obscuredAfter12&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;li&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;poem&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;poems&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;try&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="n"&gt;url_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;poem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;attrs&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;href&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;except&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class="k"&gt;pass&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Below is a list of all the scraped URLs for William Wordsworth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;At this stage, I will define a scrape_poem function to use the previously extracted list of URLs and source the poem text from each poem's page for Wordsworth. In order to remove all the unnecessary code, I'll add the remove_tags() method to derive the final poem text.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;scrape_poem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;poemurl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;poemurl&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;get&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;soup&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;html&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;soup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;div&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;class&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;o-poem &amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;remove_tags&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Next, I'll run a for loop and use the previously defined function to create a new list with all of Wordsworth's poems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wordsworth_poems_list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;url_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;time&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sleep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;wordsworth_poems_list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;scrape_poem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;url&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wordsworth_poems_list&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Who is the happy Warrior? Who is heThat every man in arms should wish to be?—It is the generous Spirit, who, when broughtAmong the tasks of real life, hath wroughtUpon the plan that pleased his boyish thought:Whose high endeavours are an inward lightThat makes the path before him always bright;Who, with a natural instinct to discernWhat knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn;Abides by this resolve, and stops not there,But makes his moral being his prime care;Who, doomed to go in company with Pain,And Fear, and Bloodshed, miserable train!Turns his necessity to glorious gain;In face of these doth exercise a powerWhich is our human nature&amp;#39;s highest dower:Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereavesOf their bad influence, and their good receives:By objects, which might force the soul to abateHer feeling, rendered more compassionate;Is placable—because occasions riseSo often that demand such sacrifice;More skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure,As tempted more; more able to endure,As more exposed to suffering and distress;Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.—&amp;#39;Tis he whose law is reason; who dependsUpon that law as on the best of friends;Whence, in a state where men are tempted stillTo evil for a guard against worse ill,And what in quality or act is bestDoth seldom on a right foundation rest,He labours good on good to fix, and owesTo virtue every triumph that he knows:—Who, if he rise to station of command,Rises by open means; and there will standOn honourable terms, or else retire,And in himself possess his own desire;Who comprehends his trust, and to the sameKeeps faithful with a singleness of aim;And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in waitFor wealth, or honours, or for worldly state;Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,Like showers of manna, if they come at all:Whose powers shed round him in the common strife,Or mild concerns of ordinary life,A constant influence, a peculiar grace;But who, if he be called upon to faceSome awful moment to which Heaven has joinedGreat issues, good or bad for human kind,Is happy as a Lover; and attiredWith sudden brightness, like a Man inspired;And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the lawIn calmness made, and sees what he foresaw;Or if an unexpected call succeed,Come when it will, is equal to the need:—He who, though thus endued as with a senseAnd faculty for storm and turbulence,Is yet a Soul whose master-bias leansTo homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes;Sweet images! which, wheresoe&amp;#39;er he be,Are at his heart; and such fidelityIt is his darling passion to approve;More brave for this, that he hath much to love:—&amp;#39;Tis, finally, the Man, who, lifted high,Conspicuous object in a Nation&amp;#39;s eye,Or left unthought-of in obscurity,—Who, with a toward or untoward lot,Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not—Plays, in the many games of life, that oneWhere what he most doth value must be won:Whom neither shape or danger can dismay,Nor thought of tender happiness betray;Who, not content that former worth stand fast,Looks forward, persevering to the last,From well to better, daily self-surpast:Who, whether praise of him must walk the earthFor ever, and to noble deeds give birth,Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame,And leave a dead unprofitable name—Finds comfort in himself and in his cause;And, while the mortal mist is gathering, drawsHis breath in confidence of Heaven&amp;#39;s applause:This is the happy Warrior; this is heThat every man in arms should wish to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;There is a change—and I am poor; Your love hath been, nor long ago, A fountain at my fond heart&amp;#39;s door, Whose only business was to flow; And flow it did; not taking heed Of its own bounty, or my need. What happy moments did I count! Blest was I then all bliss above! Now, for that consecrated fount Of murmuring, sparkling, living love, What have I? shall I dare to tell? A comfortless and hidden well. A well of love—it may be deep— I trust it is,—and never dry: What matter? if the waters sleep In silence and obscurity. —Such change, and at the very door Of my fond heart, hath made me poor.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Earth has not any thing to show more fair: Dull would he be of soul who could pass by A sight so touching in its majesty: This City now doth, like a garment, wear The beauty of the morning; silent, bare, Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie Open unto the fields, and to the sky; All bright and glittering in the smokeless air. Never did sun more beautifully steep In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill; Ne&amp;#39;er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep! The river glideth at his own sweet will: Dear God! the very houses seem asleep; And all that mighty heart is lying still!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile! Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee: I saw thee every day; and all the while Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea. So pure the sky, so quiet was the air! So like, so very like, was day to day! Whene&amp;#39;er I looked, thy Image still was there; It trembled, but it never passed away. How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep; No mood, which season takes away, or brings: I could have fancied that the mighty Deep Was even the gentlest of all gentle things. Ah! then , if mine had been the Painter&amp;#39;s hand, To express what then I saw; and add the gleam, The light that never was, on sea or land, The consecration, and the Poet&amp;#39;s dream; I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile Amid a world how different from this! Beside a sea that could not cease to smile; On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss. Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;— Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine The very sweetest had to thee been given. A Picture had it been of lasting ease, Elysian quiet, without toil or strife; No motion but the moving tide, a breeze, Or merely silent Nature&amp;#39;s breathing life. Such, in the fond illusion of my heart, Such Picture would I at that time have made: And seen the soul of truth in every part, A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed. So once it would have been,—&amp;#39;tis so no more; I have submitted to a new control: A power is gone, which nothing can restore; A deep distress hath humanised my Soul. Not for a moment could I now behold A smiling sea, and be what I have been: The feeling of my loss will ne&amp;#39;er be old; This, which I know, I speak with mind serene. Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend, If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore, This work of thine I blame not, but commend; This sea in anger, and that dismal shore. O &amp;#39;tis a passionate Work!—yet wise and well, Well chosen is the spirit that is here; That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell, This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear! And this huge Castle, standing here sublime, I love to see the look with which it braves, Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time, The lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves. Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone, Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind! Such happiness, wherever it be known, Is to be pitied; for &amp;#39;tis surely blind. But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer, And frequent sights of what is to be borne! Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.— Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;When first, descending from the moorlands, I saw the Stream of Yarrow glide Along a bare and open valley, The Ettrick Shepherd was my guide. When last along its banks I wandered, Through groves that had begun to shed Their golden leaves upon the pathways, My steps the Border-minstrel led. The mighty Minstrel breathes no longer, \&amp;#39;Mid mouldering ruins low he lies; And death upon the braes of Yarrow, Has closed the Shepherd-poet\&amp;#39;s eyes: Nor has the rolling year twice measured, From sign to sign, its stedfast course, Since every mortal power of Coleridge Was frozen at its marvellous source; The rapt One, of the godlike forehead, The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth: And Lamb, the frolic and the gentle, Has vanished from his lonely hearth. Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits, Or waves that own no curbing hand, How fast has brother followed brother, From sunshine to the sunless land! Yet I, whose lids from infant slumber Were earlier raised, remain to hear A timid voice, that asks in whispers, &amp;quot;Who next will drop and disappear?&amp;quot; Our haughty life is crowned with darkness, Like London with its own black wreath, On which with thee, O Crabbe! forth-looking, I gazed from Hampstead\&amp;#39;s breezy heath. As if but yesterday departed, Thou too art gone before; but why, O\&amp;#39;er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered, Should frail survivors heave a sigh? Mourn rather for that holy Spirit, Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep; For Her who, ere her summer faded, Has sunk into a breathless sleep. No more of old romantic sorrows, For slaughtered Youth or love-lorn Maid! With sharper grief is Yarrow smitten, And Ettrick mourns with her their Poet dead.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy! For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood Upon our side, we who were strong in love! Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive, But to be young was very heaven!—Oh! times, In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways Of custom, law, and statute, took at once The attraction of a country in romance! When Reason seemed the most to assert her rights, When most intent on making of herself A prime Enchantress—to assist the work Which then was going forward in her name! Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth, The beauty wore of promise, that which sets (As at some moment might not be unfelt Among the bowers of paradise itself ) The budding rose above the rose full blown. What temper at the prospect did not wake To happiness unthought of? The inert Were roused, and lively natures rapt away! They who had fed their childhood upon dreams, The playfellows of fancy, who had made All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength Their ministers,—who in lordly wise had stirred Among the grandest objects of the sense, And dealt with whatsoever they found there As if they had within some lurking right To wield it;—they, too, who, of gentle mood, Had watched all gentle motions, and to these Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more wild, And in the region of their peaceful selves;— Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty Did both find, helpers to their heart&amp;#39;s desire, And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish; Were called upon to exercise their skill, Not in Utopia, subterranean fields, Or some secreted island, Heaven knows where! But in the very world, which is the world Of all of us,—the place where in the end We find our happiness, or not at all!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed Their snow-white blossoms on my head, With brightest sunshine round me spread Of spring&amp;#39;s unclouded weather, In this sequestered nook how sweet To sit upon my orchard-seat! And birds and flowers once more to greet, My last year&amp;#39;s friends together. One have I marked, the happiest guest In all this covert of the blest: Hail to Thee, far above the rest In joy of voice and pinion! Thou, Linnet! in thy green array, Presiding Spirit here to-day, Dost lead the revels of the May; And this is thy dominion. While birds, and butterflies, and flowers, Make all one band of paramours, Thou, ranging up and down the bowers, Art sole in thy employment: A Life, a Presence like the Air, Scattering thy gladness without care, Too blest with any one to pair; Thyself thy own enjoyment. Amid yon tuft of hazel trees, That twinkle to the gusty breeze, Behold him perched in ecstasies, Yet seeming still to hover; There! where the flutter of his wings Upon his back and body flings Shadows and sunny glimmerings, That cover him all over. My dazzled sight he oft deceives, A brother of the dancing leaves; Then flits, and from the cottage-eaves Pours forth his song in gushes; As if by that exulting strain He mocked and treated with disdain The voiceless Form he chose to feign, While fluttering in the bushes.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I travelled among unknown men, In lands beyond the sea; Nor, England! did I know till then What love I bore to thee. &amp;#39;Tis past, that melancholy dream! Nor will I quit thy shore A second time; for still I seem To love thee more and more. Among thy mountains did I feel The joy of my desire; And she I cherished turned her wheel Beside an English fire. Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed, The bowers where Lucy played; And thine too is the last green field That Lucy&amp;#39;s eyes surveyed.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o&amp;#39;er vales and hills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. Continuous as the stars that shine And twinkle on the milky way, They stretched in never-ending line Along the margin of a bay: Ten thousand saw I at a glance, Tossing their heads in sprightly dance. The waves beside them danced; but they Out-did the sparkling waves in glee: A poet could not but be gay, In such a jocund company: I gazed—and gazed—but little thought What wealth the show to me had brought: For oft, when on my couch I lie In vacant or in pensive mood, They flash upon that inward eye Which is the bliss of solitude; And then my heart with pleasure fills, And dances with the daffodils.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Wisdom and Spirit of the universe! Thou Soul, that art the Eternity of thought! And giv&amp;#39;st to forms and images a breath And everlasting motion! not in vain, By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me The passions that build up our human soul; Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man; But with high objects, with enduring things, With life and nature; purifying thus The elements of feeling and of thought, And sanctifying by such discipline Both pain and fear,—until we recognise A grandeur in the beatings of the heart. Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me With stinted kindness. In November days, When vapours rolling down the valleys made A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods At noon; and &amp;#39;mid the calm of summer nights, When, by the margin of the trembling lake, Beneath the gloomy hills, homeward I went In solitude, such intercourse was mine: Mine was it in the fields both day and night, And by the waters, all the summer long. And in the frosty season, when the sun Was set, and, visible for many a mile, The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed, I heeded not the summons: happy time It was indeed for all of us; for me It was a time of rapture! Clear and loud The village-clock tolled six—I wheeled about, Proud and exulting like an untired horse That cares not for his home.—All shod with steel We hissed along the polished ice, in games Confederate, imitative of the chase And woodland pleasures,—the resounding horn, The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare. So through the darkness and the cold we flew, And not a voice was idle; with the din Smitten, the precipices rang aloud; The leafless trees and every icy crag Tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars, Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west The orange sky of evening died away. Not seldom from the uproar I retired Into a silent bay, or sportively Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, To cut across the reflex of a star; Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes, When we had given our bodies to the wind, And all the shadowy banks on either side Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still The rapid line of motion, then at once Have I, reclining back upon my heels, Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs Wheeled by me—even as if the earth had rolled With visible motion her diurnal round! Behind me did they stretch in solemn train, Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watched Till all was tranquil as a summer sea.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Tax not the royal Saint with vain expense,With ill-matched aims the Architect who planned—Albeit labouring for a scanty bandOf white-robed Scholars only—this immenseAnd glorious Work of fine intelligence!Give all thou canst; high Heaven rejects the loreOf nicely-calculated less or more;So deemed the man who fashioned for the senseThese lofty pillars, spread that branching roofSelf-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells,Where light and shade repose, where music dwellsLingering—and wandering on as loth to die;Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proofThat they were born for immortality.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;It is a beauteous evening, calm and free, The holy time is quiet as a Nun Breathless with adoration; the broad sun Is sinking down in its tranquility; The gentleness of heaven broods o&amp;#39;er the Sea; Listen! the mighty Being is awake, And doth with his eternal motion make A sound like thunder—everlastingly. Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here, If thou appear untouched by solemn thought, Thy nature is not therefore less divine: Thou liest in Abraham&amp;#39;s bosom all the year; And worshipp&amp;#39;st at the Temple&amp;#39;s inner shrine, God being with thee when we know it not.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;It is not to be thought of that the FloodOf British freedom, which, to the open seaOf the world\&amp;#39;s praise, from dark antiquityHath flowed, &amp;quot;with pomp of waters, unwithstood,&amp;quot;Roused though it be full often to a moodWhich spurns the check of salutary bands,That this most famous Stream in bogs and sandsShould perish; and to evil and to goodBe lost for ever. In our halls is hungArmoury of the invincible Knights of old:We must be free or die, who speak the tongueThat Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals holdWhich Milton held.—In every thing we are sprungOf Earth\&amp;#39;s first blood, have titles manifold.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;With sacrifice before the rising morn Vows have I made by fruitless hope inspired; And from the infernal Gods, \&amp;#39;mid shades forlorn Of night, my slaughtered Lord have I required: Celestial pity I again implore;— Restore him to my sight—great Jove, restore!&amp;quot; So speaking, and by fervent love endowed With faith, the Suppliant heavenward lifts her hands; While, like the sun emerging from a cloud, Her countenance brightens—and her eye expands; Her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows; As she expects the issue in repose. O terror! what hath she perceived?—O joy! What doth she look on?—whom doth she behold? Her Hero slain upon the beach of Troy? His vital presence? his corporeal mould? It is—if sense deceive her not—\&amp;#39;tis He! And a God leads him, wingèd Mercury! Mild Hermes spake—and touched her with his wand That calms all fear; &amp;quot;Such grace hath crowned thy prayer, Laodamía! that at Jove\&amp;#39;s command Thy husband walks the paths of upper air: He comes to tarry with thee three hours\&amp;#39; space; Accept the gift, behold him face to face!&amp;quot; Forth sprang the impassioned Queen her Lord to clasp; Again that consummation she essayed; But unsubstantial Form eludes her grasp As often as that eager grasp was made. The Phantom parts—but parts to re-unite, And re-assume his place before her sight. &amp;quot;Protesiláus, lo! thy guide is gone! Confirm, I pray, the vision with thy voice: This is our palace,—yonder is thy throne; Speak, and the floor thou tread\&amp;#39;st on will rejoice. Not to appal me have the gods bestowed This precious boon; and blest a sad abode.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Great Jove, Laodamía! doth not leave His gifts imperfect:—Spectre though I be, I am not sent to scare thee or deceive; But in reward of thy fidelity. And something also did my worth obtain; For fearless virtue bringeth boundless gain. &amp;quot;Thou knowest, the Delphic oracle foretold That the first Greek who touched the Trojan strand Should die; but me the threat could not withhold: A generous cause a victim did demand; And forth I leapt upon the sandy plain; A self-devoted chief—by Hector slain.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Supreme of Heroes—bravest, noblest, best! Thy matchless courage I bewail no more, Which then, when tens of thousands were deprest By doubt, propelled thee to the fatal shore; Thou found\&amp;#39;st—and I forgive thee—here thou art— A nobler counsellor than my poor heart. &amp;quot;But thou, though capable of sternest deed, Wert kind as resolute, and good as brave; And he, whose power restores thee, hath decreed Thou should\&amp;#39;st elude the malice of the grave: Redundant are thy locks, thy lips as fair As when their breath enriched Thessalian air. &amp;quot;No spectre greets me,—no vain Shadow this; Come, blooming Hero, place thee by my side! Give, on this well-known couch, one nuptial kiss To me, this day a second time thy bride!&amp;quot; Jove frowned in heaven: the conscious Parcæ threw Upon those roseate lips a Stygian hue. &amp;quot;This visage tells thee that my doom is past: Nor should the change be mourned, even if the joys Of sense were able to return as fast And surely as they vanish. Earth destroys Those raptures duly—-Erebus disdains: Calm pleasures there abide—majestic pains. &amp;quot;Be taught, O faithful Consort, to control Rebellious passion: for the Gods approve The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul; A fervent, not ungovernable love. Thy transports moderate; and meekly mourn When I depart, for brief is my sojourn—&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Ah wherefore?—Did not Hercules by force Wrest from the guardian monster of the tomb Alcestis, a reanimated corse, Given back to dwell on earth in vernal bloom? Medea\&amp;#39;s spells dispersed the weight of years, And Æson stood a youth \&amp;#39;mid youthful peers. &amp;quot;The Gods to us are merciful—and they Yet further may relent: for mightier far Than strength of nerve and sinew, or the sway Of magic potent over sun and star, Is love, though oft to agony distrest, And though his favourite seat be feeble woman\&amp;#39;s breast. &amp;quot;But if thou goest, I follow—&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Peace!&amp;quot; he said,— She looked upon him and was calmed and cheered; The ghastly colour from his lips had fled; In his deportment, shape, and mien, appeared Elysian beauty, melancholy grace, Brought from a pensive though a happy place. He spake of love, such love as Spirits feel In worlds whose course is equable and pure; No fears to beat away—no strife to heal— The past unsighed for, and the future sure; Spake of heroic arts in graver mood Revived, with finer harmony pursued; Of all that is most beauteous—imaged there In happier beauty; more pellucid streams, An ampler ether, a diviner air, And fields invested with purpureal gleams; Climes which the sun, who sheds the brightest day Earth knows, is all unworthy to survey. Yet there the Soul shall enter which hath earned That privilege by virtue.—&amp;quot;Ill,&amp;quot; said he, &amp;quot;The end of man\&amp;#39;s existence I discerned, Who from ignoble games and revelry Could draw, when we had parted, vain delight, While tears were thy best pastime, day and night; &amp;quot;And while my youthful peers before my eyes (Each hero following his peculiar bent) Prepared themselves for glorious enterprise By martial sports,—or, seated in the tent, Chieftains and kings in council were detained; What time the fleet at Aulis lay enchained. &amp;quot;The wished-for wind was given:—I then revolved The oracle, upon the silent sea; And, if no worthier led the way, resolved That, of a thousand vessels, mine should be The foremost prow in pressing to the strand,— Mine the first blood that tinged the Trojan sand. &amp;quot;Yet bitter, oft-times bitter, was the pang When of thy loss I thought, belovèd Wife! On thee too fondly did my memory hang, And on the joys we shared in mortal life,— The paths which we had trod—these fountains, flowers: My new-planned cities, and unfinished towers. &amp;quot;But should suspense permit the Foe to cry, \&amp;#39;Behold they tremble!—haughty their array, Yet of their numbers no one dares to die?\&amp;#39; In soul I swept the indignity away: Old frailties then recurred:—but lofty thought, In act embodied, my deliverance wrought. &amp;quot;And Thou, though strong in love, art all too weak In reason, in self-government too slow; I counsel thee by fortitude to seek Our blest re-union in the shades below. The invisible world with thee hath sympathised; Be thy affections raised and solemnised. &amp;quot;Learn, by a mortal yearning, to ascend— Seeking a higher object. Love was given, Encouraged, sanctioned, chiefly for that end; For this the passion to excess was driven— That self might be annulled: her bondage prove The fetters of a dream opposed to love.— Aloud she shrieked! for Hermes re-appears! Round the dear Shade she would have clung—\&amp;#39;tis vain: The hours are past—too brief had they been years; And him no mortal effort can detain: Swift, toward the realms that know not earthly day, He through the portal takes his silent way, And on the palace-floor a lifeless corse She lay. Thus, all in vain exhorted and reproved, She perished; and, as for a wilful crime, By the just Gods whom no weak pity moved, Was doomed to wear out her appointed time, Apart from happy Ghosts, that gather flowers Of blissful quiet \&amp;#39;mid unfading bowers. —Yet tears to human suffering are due; And mortal hopes defeated and o\&amp;#39;erthrown Are mourned by man, and not by man alone, As fondly he believes.—Upon the side Of Hellespont (such faith was entertained) A knot of spiry trees for ages grew From out the tomb of him for whom she died; And ever, when such stature they had gained That Ilium\&amp;#39;s walls were subject to their view, The trees\&amp;#39; tall summits withered at the sight; A constant interchange of growth and blight!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Five years have past; five summers, with the length Of five long winters! and again I hear These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs With a soft inland murmur.—Once again Do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs, That on a wild secluded scene impress Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect The landscape with the quiet of the sky. The day is come when I again repose Here, under this dark sycamore, and view These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts, Which at this season, with their unripe fruits, Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves &amp;#39;Mid groves and copses. Once again I see These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms, Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke Sent up, in silence, from among the trees! With some uncertain notice, as might seem Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods, Or of some Hermit&amp;#39;s cave, where by his fire The Hermit sits alone. These beauteous forms, Through a long absence, have not been to me As is a landscape to a blind man&amp;#39;s eye: But oft, in lonely rooms, and &amp;#39;mid the din Of towns and cities, I have owed to them, In hours of weariness, sensations sweet, Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart; And passing even into my purer mind With tranquil restoration:—feelings too Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps, As have no slight or trivial influence On that best portion of a good man&amp;#39;s life, His little, nameless, unremembered, acts Of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust, To them I may have owed another gift, Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood, In which the burthen of the mystery, In which the heavy and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world, Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood, In which the affections gently lead us on,— Until, the breath of this corporeal frame And even the motion of our human blood Almost suspended, we are laid asleep In body, and become a living soul: While with an eye made quiet by the power Of harmony, and the deep power of joy, We see into the life of things. If this Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft— In darkness and amid the many shapes Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir Unprofitable, and the fever of the world, Have hung upon the beatings of my heart— How oft, in spirit, have I turned to thee, O sylvan Wye! thou wanderer thro&amp;#39; the woods, How often has my spirit turned to thee! And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought, With many recognitions dim and faint, And somewhat of a sad perplexity, The picture of the mind revives again: While here I stand, not only with the sense Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts That in this moment there is life and food For future years. And so I dare to hope, Though changed, no doubt, from what I was when first I came among these hills; when like a roe I bounded o&amp;#39;er the mountains, by the sides Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams, Wherever nature led: more like a man Flying from something that he dreads, than one Who sought the thing he loved. For nature then (The coarser pleasures of my boyish days And their glad animal movements all gone by) To me was all in all.—I cannot paint What then I was. The sounding cataract Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock, The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, Their colours and their forms, were then to me An appetite; a feeling and a love, That had no need of a remoter charm, By thought supplied, not any interest Unborrowed from the eye.—That time is past, And all its aching joys are now no more, And all its dizzy raptures. Not for this Faint I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts Have followed; for such loss, I would believe, Abundant recompense. For I have learned To look on nature, not as in the hour Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes The still sad music of humanity, Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power To chasten and subdue.—And I have felt A presence that disturbs me with the joy Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime Of something far more deeply interfused, Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns, And the round ocean and the living air, And the blue sky, and in the mind of man: A motion and a spirit, that impels All thinking things, all objects of all thought, And rolls through all things. Therefore am I still A lover of the meadows and the woods And mountains; and of all that we behold From this green earth; of all the mighty world Of eye, and ear,—both what they half create, And what perceive; well pleased to recognise In nature and the language of the sense The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse, The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul Of all my moral being. Nor perchance, If I were not thus taught, should I the more Suffer my genial spirits to decay: For thou art with me here upon the banks Of this fair river; thou my dearest Friend, My dear, dear Friend; and in thy voice I catch The language of my former heart, and read My former pleasures in the shooting lights Of thy wild eyes. Oh! yet a little while May I behold in thee what I was once, My dear, dear Sister! and this prayer I make, Knowing that Nature never did betray The heart that loved her; &amp;#39;tis her privilege, Through all the years of this our life, to lead From joy to joy: for she can so inform The mind that is within us, so impress With quietness and beauty, and so feed With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues, Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men, Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all The dreary intercourse of daily life, Shall e&amp;#39;er prevail against us, or disturb Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold Is full of blessings. Therefore let the moon Shine on thee in thy solitary walk; And let the misty mountain-winds be free To blow against thee: and, in after years, When these wild ecstasies shall be matured Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms, Thy memory be as a dwelling-place For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then, If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief, Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts Of tender joy wilt thou remember me, And these my exhortations! Nor, perchance— If I should be where I no more can hear Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams Of past existence—wilt thou then forget That on the banks of this delightful stream We stood together; and that I, so long A worshipper of Nature, hither came Unwearied in that service: rather say With warmer love—oh! with far deeper zeal Of holier love. Nor wilt thou then forget, That after many wanderings, many years Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs, And this green pastoral landscape, were to me More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;I heard a thousand blended notes, While in a grove I sate reclined, In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts Bring sad thoughts to the mind. To her fair works did Nature link The human soul that through me ran; And much it grieved my heart to think What man has made of man. Through primrose tufts, in that green bower, The periwinkle trailed its wreaths; And ’tis my faith that every flower Enjoys the air it breathes. The birds around me hopped and played, Their thoughts I cannot measure:— But the least motion which they made It seemed a thrill of pleasure. The budding twigs spread out their fan, To catch the breezy air; And I must think, do all I can, That there was pleasure there. If this belief from heaven be sent, If such be Nature’s holy plan, Have I not reason to lament What man has made of man?&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour:England hath need of thee: she is a fenOf stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen,Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower,Have forfeited their ancient English dowerOf inward happiness. We are selfish men;Oh! raise us up, return to us again;And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power.Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart:Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea:Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,So didst thou travel on life&amp;#39;s common way,In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heartThe lowliest duties on herself did lay.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Most sweet it is with unuplifted eyesTo pace the ground, if path be there or none,While a fair region round the traveller liesWhich he forbears again to look upon;Pleased rather with some soft ideal scene,The work of Fancy, or some happy toneOf meditation, slipping in betweenThe beauty coming and the beauty gone.If Thought and Love desert us, from that dayLet us break off all commerce with the Muse:With Thought and Love companions of our way,Whate&amp;#39;er the senses take or may refuse,The Mind&amp;#39;s internal heaven shall shed her dewsOf inspiration on the humblest lay.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;From low to high doth dissolution climb, And sink from high to low, along a scale Of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail; A musical but melancholy chime, Which they can hear who meddle not with crime, Nor avarice, nor over-anxious care. Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear The longest date do melt like frosty rime, That in the morning whitened hill and plain And is no more; drop like the tower sublime Of yesterday, which royally did wear His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain Some casual shout that broke the silent air, Or the unimaginable touch of Time.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Another year!—another deadly blow!Another mighty Empire overthrown!And We are left, or shall be left, alone;The last that dare to struggle with the Foe.&amp;#39;Tis well! from this day forward we shall knowThat in ourselves our safety must be sought;That by our own right hands it must be wrought;That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low.O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer!We shall exult, if they who rule the landBe men who hold its many blessings dear,Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band,Who are to judge of danger which they fear,And honour which they do not understand.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room; And hermits are contented with their cells; And students with their pensive citadels; Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom, Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom, High as the highest Peak of Furness-fells, Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells: In truth the prison, into which we doom Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me, In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound Within the Sonnet’s scanty plot of ground; Pleased if some Souls (for such there needs must be) Who have felt the weight of too much liberty, Should find brief solace there, as I have found.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;—It seems a day(I speak of one from many singled out)One of those heavenly days that cannot die;When, in the eagerness of boyish hope,I left our cottage-threshold, sallying forthWith a huge wallet o&amp;#39;er my shoulders slung,A nutting-crook in hand; and turned my stepsTow&amp;#39;rd some far-distant wood, a Figure quaint,Tricked out in proud disguise of cast-off weedsWhich for that service had been husbanded,By exhortation of my frugal Dame—Motley accoutrement, of power to smileAt thorns, and brakes, and brambles,—and, in truth,More ragged than need was! O&amp;#39;er pathless rocks,Through beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets,Forcing my way, I came to one dear nookUnvisited, where not a broken boughDrooped with its withered leaves, ungracious signOf devastation; but the hazels roseTall and erect, with tempting clusters hung,A virgin scene!—A little while I stood,Breathing with such suppression of the heartAs joy delights in; and, with wise restraintVoluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyedThe banquet;—or beneath the trees I sateAmong the flowers, and with the flowers I played;A temper known to those, who, after longAnd weary expectation, have been blestWith sudden happiness beyond all hope.Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leavesThe violets of five seasons re-appearAnd fade, unseen by any human eye;Where fairy water-breaks do murmur onFor ever; and I saw the sparkling foam,And—with my cheek on one of those green stonesThat, fleeced with moss, under the shady trees,Lay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep—I heard the murmur, and the murmuring sound,In that sweet mood when pleasure loves to payTribute to ease; and, of its joy secure,The heart luxuriates with indifferent things,Wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones,And on the vacant air. Then up I rose,And dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crashAnd merciless ravage: and the shady nookOf hazels, and the green and mossy bower,Deformed and sullied, patiently gave upTheir quiet being: and, unless I nowConfound my present feelings with the past;Ere from the mutilated bower I turnedExulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings,I felt a sense of pain when I beheldThe silent trees, and saw the intruding sky.—Then, dearest Maiden, move along these shadesIn gentleness of heart; with gentle handTouch—for there is a spirit in the woods.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;These times strike monied worldlings with dismay:Even rich men, brave by nature, taint the airWith words of apprehension and despair:While tens of thousands, thinking on the affray,Men unto whom sufficient for the dayAnd minds not stinted or untilled are given,Sound, healthy, children of the God of heaven,Are cheerful as the rising sun in May.What do we gather hence but firmer faithThat every gift of noble originIs breathed upon by Hope&amp;#39;s perpetual breath;That virtue and the faculties withinAre vital,—and that riches are akinTo fear, to change, to cowardice, and death?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;The child is father of the man; And I could wish my days to be Bound each to each by natural piety. (Wordsworth, &amp;quot;My Heart Leaps Up&amp;quot;) There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, The earth, and every common sight, To me did seem Apparelled in celestial light, The glory and the freshness of a dream. It is not now as it hath been of yore;— Turn wheresoe\&amp;#39;er I may, By night or day. The things which I have seen I now can see no more. The Rainbow comes and goes, And lovely is the Rose, The Moon doth with delight Look round her when the heavens are bare, Waters on a starry night Are beautiful and fair; The sunshine is a glorious birth; But yet I know, where\&amp;#39;er I go, That there hath past away a glory from the earth. Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song, And while the young lambs bound As to the tabor\&amp;#39;s sound, To me alone there came a thought of grief: A timely utterance gave that thought relief, And I again am strong: The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep; No more shall grief of mine the season wrong; I hear the Echoes through the mountains throng, The Winds come to me from the fields of sleep, And all the earth is gay; Land and sea Give themselves up to jollity, And with the heart of May Doth every Beast keep holiday;— Thou Child of Joy, Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy Shepherd-boy. Ye blessèd creatures, I have heard the call Ye to each other make; I see The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee; My heart is at your festival, My head hath its coronal, The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all. Oh evil day! if I were sullen While Earth herself is adorning, This sweet May-morning, And the Children are culling On every side, In a thousand valleys far and wide, Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm, And the Babe leaps up on his Mother\&amp;#39;s arm:— I hear, I hear, with joy I hear! —But there\&amp;#39;s a Tree, of many, one, A single field which I have looked upon, Both of them speak of something that is gone; The Pansy at my feet Doth the same tale repeat: Whither is fled the visionary gleam? Where is it now, the glory and the dream? Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting: The Soul that rises with us, our life\&amp;#39;s Star, Hath had elsewhere its setting, And cometh from afar: Not in entire forgetfulness, And not in utter nakedness, But trailing clouds of glory do we come From God, who is our home: Heaven lies about us in our infancy! Shades of the prison-house begin to close Upon the growing Boy, But he beholds the light, and whence it flows, He sees it in his joy; The Youth, who daily farther from the east Must travel, still is Nature\&amp;#39;s Priest, And by the vision splendid Is on his way attended; At length the Man perceives it die away, And fade into the light of common day. Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own; Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind, And, even with something of a Mother\&amp;#39;s mind, And no unworthy aim, The homely Nurse doth all she can To make her Foster-child, her Inmate Man, Forget the glories he hath known, And that imperial palace whence he came. Behold the Child among his new-born blisses, A six years\&amp;#39; Darling of a pigmy size! See, where \&amp;#39;mid work of his own hand he lies, Fretted by sallies of his mother\&amp;#39;s kisses, With light upon him from his father\&amp;#39;s eyes! See, at his feet, some little plan or chart, Some fragment from his dream of human life, Shaped by himself with newly-learn{e}d art A wedding or a festival, A mourning or a funeral; And this hath now his heart, And unto this he frames his song: Then will he fit his tongue To dialogues of business, love, or strife; But it will not be long Ere this be thrown aside, And with new joy and pride The little Actor cons another part; Filling from time to time his &amp;quot;humorous stage&amp;quot; With all the Persons, down to palsied Age, That Life brings with her in her equipage; As if his whole vocation Were endless imitation. Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie Thy Soul\&amp;#39;s immensity; Thou best Philosopher, who yet dost keep Thy heritage, thou Eye among the blind, That, deaf and silent, read\&amp;#39;st the eternal deep, Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,— Mighty Prophet! Seer blest! On whom those truths do rest, Which we are toiling all our lives to find, In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave; Thou, over whom thy Immortality Broods like the Day, a Master o\&amp;#39;er a Slave, A Presence which is not to be put by; Thou little Child, yet glorious in the might Of heaven-born freedom on thy being\&amp;#39;s height, Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke The years to bring the inevitable yoke, Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife? Full soon thy Soul shall have her earthly freight, And custom lie upon thee with a weight, Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life! O joy! that in our embers Is something that doth live, That Nature yet remembers What was so fugitive! The thought of our past years in me doth breed Perpetual benediction: not indeed For that which is most worthy to be blest; Delight and liberty, the simple creed Of Childhood, whether busy or at rest, With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:— Not for these I raise The song of thanks and praise But for those obstinate questionings Of sense and outward things, Fallings from us, vanishings; Blank misgivings of a Creature Moving about in worlds not realised, High instincts before which our mortal Nature Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised: But for those first affections, Those shadowy recollections, Which, be they what they may Are yet the fountain-light of all our day, Are yet a master-light of all our seeing; Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make Our noisy years seem moments in the being Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake, To perish never; Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour, Nor Man nor Boy, Nor all that is at enmity with joy, Can utterly abolish or destroy! Hence in a season of calm weather Though inland far we be, Our Souls have sight of that immortal sea Which brought us hither, Can in a moment travel thither, And see the Children sport upon the shore, And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore. Then sing, ye Birds, sing, sing a joyous song! And let the young Lambs bound As to the tabor\&amp;#39;s sound! We in thought will join your throng, Ye that pipe and ye that play, Ye that through your hearts to-day Feel the gladness of the May! What though the radiance which was once so bright Be now for ever taken from my sight, Though nothing can bring back the hour Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower; We will grieve not, rather find Strength in what remains behind; In the primal sympathy Which having been must ever be; In the soothing thoughts that spring Out of human suffering; In the faith that looks through death, In years that bring the philosophic mind. And O, ye Fountains, Meadows, Hills, and Groves, Forebode not any severing of our loves! Yet in my heart of hearts I feel your might; I only have relinquished one delight To live beneath your more habitual sway. I love the Brooks which down their channels fret, Even more than when I tripped lightly as they; The innocent brightness of a new-born Day Is lovely yet; The Clouds that gather round the setting sun Do take a sober colouring from an eye That hath kept watch o\&amp;#39;er man\&amp;#39;s mortality; Another race hath been, and other palms are won. Thanks to the human heart by which we live, Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears, To me the meanest flower that blows can give Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Jam non consilio bonus, sed more eo perductus, ut non tantum recte facere possim, sed nisi recte facere non possim&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I am no longer good through deliberate intent, but by long habit have reached a point where I am not only able to do right, but am unable to do anything but what is right.&amp;quot; (Seneca, Letters 120.10) Stern Daughter of the Voice of God! O Duty! if that name thou love Who art a light to guide, a rod To check the erring, and reprove; Thou, who art victory and law When empty terrors overawe; From vain temptations dost set free; And calm\&amp;#39;st the weary strife of frail humanity! There are who ask not if thine eye Be on them; who, in love and truth, Where no misgiving is, rely Upon the genial sense of youth: Glad Hearts! without reproach or blot; Who do thy work, and know it not: Oh! if through confidence misplaced They fail, thy saving arms, dread Power! around them cast. Serene will be our days and bright, And happy will our nature be, When love is an unerring light, And joy its own security. And they a blissful course may hold Even now, who, not unwisely bold, Live in the spirit of this creed; Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need. I, loving freedom, and untried; No sport of every random gust, Yet being to myself a guide, Too blindly have reposed my trust: And oft, when in my heart was heard Thy timely mandate, I deferred The task, in smoother walks to stray; But thee I now would serve more strictly, if I may. Through no disturbance of my soul, Or strong compunction in me wrought, I supplicate for thy control; But in the quietness of thought: Me this unchartered freedom tires; I feel the weight of chance-desires: My hopes no more must change their name, I long for a repose that ever is the same. Stern Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear The Godhead\&amp;#39;s most benignant grace; Nor know we anything so fair As is the smile upon thy face: Flowers laugh before thee on their beds And fragrance in thy footing treads; Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong; And the most ancient heavens, through Thee, are fresh and strong. To humbler functions, awful Power! I call thee: I myself commend Unto thy guidance from this hour; Oh, let my weakness have an end! Give unto me, made lowly wise, The spirit of self-sacrifice; The confidence of reason give; And in the light of truth thy Bondman let me live!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;A trouble, not of clouds, or weeping rain,Nor of the setting sun&amp;#39;s pathetic lightEngendered, hangs o&amp;#39;er Eildon&amp;#39;s triple height:Spirits of Power, assembled there, complainFor kindred Power departing from their sight;While Tweed, best pleased in chanting a blithe strain,Saddens his voice again, and yet again.Lift up your hearts, ye Mourners! for the mightOf the whole world&amp;#39;s good wishes with him goes;Blessings and prayers in nobler retinueThan sceptred king or laurelled conqueror knows,Follow this wondrous Potentate. Be true,Ye winds of ocean, and the midland sea,Wafting your Charge to soft Parthenope!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;And was the safeguard of the west: the worthOf Venice did not fall below her birth,Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.She was a maiden City, bright and free;No guile seduced, no force could violate;And, when she took unto herself a Mate,She must espouse the everlasting Sea.And what if she had seen those glories fade,Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;Yet shall some tribute of regret be paidWhen her long life hath reached its final day:Men are we, and must grieve when even the ShadeOf that which once was great is passed away.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;A poet!—He hath put his heart to school,Nor dares to move unpropped upon the staffWhich art hath lodged within his hand—must laughBy precept only, and shed tears by rule.Thy Art be Nature; the live current quaff,And let the groveller sip his stagnant pool,In fear that else, when Critics grave and coolHave killed him, Scorn should write his epitaph.How does the Meadow-flower its bloom unfold?Because the lovely little flower is freeDown to its root, and, in that freedom, bold;And so the grandeur of the Forest-treeComes not by casting in a formal mould,But from its own divine vitality.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;The power of Armies is a visible thing,Formal and circumscribed in time and space;But who the limits of that power shall traceWhich a brave People into light can bringOr hide, at will,—for freedom combatingBy just revenge inflamed? No foot may chase,No eye can follow, to a fatal placeThat power, that spirit, whether on the wingLike the strong wind, or sleeping like the windWithin its awful caves.—From year to yearSprings this indigenous produce far and near;No craft this subtle element can bind,Rising like water from the soil, to findIn every nook a lip that it may cheer.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;—Was it for this That one, the fairest of all Rivers, lov&amp;#39;d To blend his murmurs with my Nurse&amp;#39;s song, And from his alder shades and rocky falls, And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice That flow&amp;#39;d along my dreams? For this, didst Thou, O Derwent! travelling over the green Plains Near my &amp;#39;sweet Birthplace&amp;#39;, didst thou, beauteous Stream Make ceaseless music through the night and day Which with its steady cadence, tempering Our human waywardness, compos&amp;#39;d my thoughts To more than infant softness, giving me, Among the fretful dwellings of mankind, A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm That Nature breathes among the hills and groves. When, having left his Mountains, to the Towers Of Cockermouth that beauteous River came, Behind my Father&amp;#39;s House he pass&amp;#39;d, close by, Along the margin of our Terrace Walk. He was a Playmate whom we dearly lov&amp;#39;d. Oh! many a time have I, a five years&amp;#39; Child, A naked Boy, in one delightful Rill, A little Mill-race sever&amp;#39;d from his stream, Made one long bathing of a summer&amp;#39;s day, Bask&amp;#39;d in the sun, and plunged, and bask&amp;#39;d again Alternate all a summer&amp;#39;s day, or cours&amp;#39;d Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill, The woods, and distant Skiddaw&amp;#39;s lofty height, Were bronz&amp;#39;d with a deep radiance, stood alone Beneath the sky, as if I had been born On Indian Plains, and from my Mother&amp;#39;s hut Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport, A naked Savage, in the thunder shower. Fair seed-time had my soul, and I grew up Foster&amp;#39;d alike by beauty and by fear; Much favour&amp;#39;d in my birthplace, and no less In that beloved Vale to which, erelong, I was transplanted. Well I call to mind (&amp;#39;Twas at an early age, ere I had seen Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp&amp;#39;d The last autumnal crocus, &amp;#39;twas my joy To wander half the night among the Cliffs And the smooth Hollows, where the woodcocks ran Along the open turf. In thought and wish That time, my shoulder all with springes hung, I was a fell destroyer. On the heights Scudding away from snare to snare, I plied My anxious visitation, hurrying on, Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars Were shining o&amp;#39;er my head; I was alone, And seem&amp;#39;d to be a trouble to the peace That was among them. Sometimes it befel In these night-wanderings, that a strong desire O&amp;#39;erpower&amp;#39;d my better reason, and the bird Which was the captive of another&amp;#39;s toils Became my prey; and, when the deed was done I heard among the solitary hills Low breathings coming after me, and sounds Of undistinguishable motion, steps Almost as silent as the turf they trod. Nor less in springtime when on southern banks The shining sun had from his knot of leaves Decoy&amp;#39;d the primrose flower, and when the Vales And woods were warm, was I a plunderer then In the high places, on the lonesome peaks Where&amp;#39;er, among the mountains and the winds, The Mother Bird had built her lodge. Though mean My object, and inglorious, yet the end Was not ignoble. Oh! when I have hung Above the raven&amp;#39;s nest, by knots of grass And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock But ill sustain&amp;#39;d, and almost, as it seem&amp;#39;d, Suspended by the blast which blew amain, Shouldering the naked crag; Oh! at that time, While on the perilous ridge I hung alone, With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind Blow through my ears! the sky seem&amp;#39;d not a sky Of earth, and with what motion mov&amp;#39;d the clouds! The mind of Man is fram&amp;#39;d even like the breath And harmony of music. There is a dark Invisible workmanship that reconciles Discordant elements, and makes them move In one society. Ah me! that all The terrors, all the early miseries Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all The thoughts and feelings which have been infus&amp;#39;d Into my mind, should ever have made up The calm existence that is mine when I Am worthy of myself! Praise to the end! Thanks likewise for the means! But I believe That Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame A favor&amp;#39;d Being, from his earliest dawn Of infancy doth open out the clouds, As at the touch of lightning, seeking him With gentlest visitation; not the less, Though haply aiming at the self-same end, Does it delight her sometimes to employ Severer interventions, ministry More palpable, and so she dealt with me. One evening (surely I was led by her) I went alone into a Shepherd&amp;#39;s Boat, A Skiff that to a Willow tree was tied Within a rocky Cave, its usual home. &amp;#39;Twas by the shores of Patterdale, a Vale Wherein I was a Stranger, thither come A School-boy Traveller, at the Holidays. Forth rambled from the Village Inn alone No sooner had I sight of this small Skiff, Discover&amp;#39;d thus by unexpected chance, Than I unloos&amp;#39;d her tether and embark&amp;#39;d. The moon was up, the Lake was shining clear Among the hoary mountains; from the Shore I push&amp;#39;d, and struck the oars and struck again In cadence, and my little Boat mov&amp;#39;d on Even like a Man who walks with stately step Though bent on speed. It was an act of stealth And troubled pleasure; not without the voice Of mountain-echoes did my Boat move on, Leaving behind her still on either side Small circles glittering idly in the moon, Until they melted all into one track Of sparkling light. A rocky Steep uprose Above the Cavern of the Willow tree And now, as suited one who proudly row&amp;#39;d With his best skill, I fix&amp;#39;d a steady view Upon the top of that same craggy ridge, The bound of the horizon, for behind Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky. She was an elfin Pinnace; lustily I dipp&amp;#39;d my oars into the silent Lake, And, as I rose upon the stroke, my Boat Went heaving through the water, like a Swan; When from behind that craggy Steep, till then The bound of the horizon, a huge Cliff, As if with voluntary power instinct, Uprear&amp;#39;d its head. I struck, and struck again And, growing still in stature, the huge Cliff Rose up between me and the stars, and still, With measur&amp;#39;d motion, like a living thing, Strode after me. With trembling hands I turn&amp;#39;d, And through the silent water stole my way Back to the Cavern of the Willow tree. There, in her mooring-place, I left my Bark, And, through the meadows homeward went, with grave And serious thoughts; and after I had seen That spectacle, for many days, my brain Work&amp;#39;d with a dim and undetermin&amp;#39;d sense Of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts There was a darkness, call it solitude, Or blank desertion, no familiar shapes Of hourly objects, images of trees, Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields; But huge and mighty Forms that do not live Like living men mov&amp;#39;d slowly through the mind By day and were the trouble of my dreams. Wisdom and Spirit of the universe! Thou Soul that art the eternity of thought! That giv&amp;#39;st to forms and images a breath And everlasting motion! not in vain, By day or star-light thus from my first dawn Of Childhood didst Thou intertwine for me The passions that build up our human Soul, Not with the mean and vulgar works of Man, But with high objects, with enduring things, With life and nature, purifying thus The elements of feeling and of thought, And sanctifying, by such discipline, Both pain and fear, until we recognize A grandeur in the beatings of the heart. Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf&amp;#39;d to me With stinted kindness. In November days, When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods At noon, and &amp;#39;mid the calm of summer nights, When, by the margin of the trembling Lake, Beneath the gloomy hills I homeward went In solitude, such intercourse was mine; &amp;#39;Twas mine among the fields both day and night, And by the waters all the summer long. And in the frosty season, when the sun Was set, and visible for many a mile The cottage windows through the twilight blaz&amp;#39;d, I heeded not the summons:—happy time It was, indeed, for all of us; to me It was a time of rapture: clear and loud The village clock toll&amp;#39;d six; I wheel&amp;#39;d about, Proud and exulting, like an untired horse, That cares not for its home.—All shod with steel, We hiss&amp;#39;d along the polish&amp;#39;d ice, in games Confederate, imitative of the chace And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn, The Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare. So through the darkness and the cold we flew, And not a voice was idle; with the din, Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud, The leafless trees, and every icy crag Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills Into the tumult sent an alien sound Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars, Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west The orange sky of evening died away. Not seldom from the uproar I retired Into a silent bay, or sportively Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng, To cut across the image of a star That gleam&amp;#39;d upon the ice: and oftentimes When we had given our bodies to the wind, And all the shadowy banks, on either side, Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still The rapid line of motion; then at once Have I, reclining back upon my heels, Stopp&amp;#39;d short, yet still the solitary Cliffs Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll&amp;#39;d With visible motion her diurnal round; Behind me did they stretch in solemn train Feebler and feebler, and I stood and watch&amp;#39;d Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep. Ye Presences of Nature, in the sky And on the earth! Ye Visions of the hills! And Souls of lonely places! can I think A vulgar hope was yours when Ye employ&amp;#39;d Such ministry, when Ye through many a year Haunting me thus among my boyish sports, On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills, Impress&amp;#39;d upon all forms the characters Of danger or desire, and thus did make The surface of the universal earth With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear, Work like a sea? Not uselessly employ&amp;#39;d, I might pursue this theme through every change Of exercise and play, to which the year Did summon us in its delightful round. We were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours, Nor saw a race in happiness and joy More worthy of the ground where they were sown. I would record with no reluctant voice The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line, True symbol of the foolishness of hope, Which with its strong enchantment led us on By rocks and pools, shut out from every star All the green summer, to forlorn cascades Among the windings of the mountain brooks. —Unfading recollections! at this hour The heart is almost mine with which I felt From some hill-top, on sunny afternoons The Kite high up among the fleecy clouds Pull at its rein, like an impatient Courser, Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days, Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly Dash&amp;#39;d headlong; and rejected by the storm. Ye lowly Cottages in which we dwelt, A ministration of your own was yours, A sanctity, a safeguard, and a love! Can I forget you, being as ye were So beautiful among the pleasant fields In which ye stood? Or can I here forget The plain and seemly countenance with which Ye dealt out your plain comforts? Yet had ye Delights and exultations of your own. Eager and never weary we pursued Our home amusements by the warm peat-fire At evening; when with pencil and with slate, In square divisions parcell&amp;#39;d out, and all With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o&amp;#39;er, We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head In strife too humble to be named in Verse. Or round the naked table, snow-white deal, Cherry or maple, sate in close array, And to the combat, Lu or Whist, led on thick-ribbed Army; not as in the world Neglected and ungratefully thrown by Even for the very service they had wrought, But husbanded through many a long campaign. Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few Had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards, Which Fate beyond the promise of their birth Had glorified, and call&amp;#39;d to represent The persons of departed Potentates. Oh! with what echoes on the Board they fell! Ironic Diamonds, Clubs, Hearts, Diamonds, Spades, A congregation piteously akin. Cheap matter did they give to boyish wit, Those sooty knaves, precipitated down With scoffs and taunts, like Vulcan out of Heaven, The paramount Ace, a moon in her eclipse, Queens, gleaming through their splendour&amp;#39;s last decay, And Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain&amp;#39;d By royal visages. Meanwhile, abroad The heavy rain was falling, or the frost Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth, And, interrupting oft the impassion&amp;#39;d game, From Esthwaite&amp;#39;s neighbouring Lake the splitting ice, While it sank down towards the water, sent, Among the meadows and the hills, its long And dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves When they are howling round the Bothnic Main. Nor, sedulous as I have been to trace How Nature by extrinsic passion first Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand, And made me love them, may I well forget How other pleasures have been mine, and joys Of subtler origin; how I have felt, Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time, Those hallow&amp;#39;d and pure motions of the sense Which seem, in their simplicity, to own An intellectual charm, that calm delight Which, if I err not, surely must belong To those first-born affinities that fit Our new existence to existing things, And, in our dawn of being, constitute The bond of union betwixt life and joy. Yes, I remember, when the changeful earth, And twice five seasons on my mind had stamp&amp;#39;d The faces of the moving year, even then, A Child, I held unconscious intercourse With the eternal Beauty, drinking in A pure organic pleasure from the lines Of curling mist, or from the level plain Of waters colour&amp;#39;d by the steady clouds. The Sands of Westmoreland, the Creeks and Bays Of Cumbria&amp;#39;s rocky limits, they can tell How when the Sea threw off his evening shade And to the Shepherd&amp;#39;s huts beneath the crags Did send sweet notice of the rising moon, How I have stood, to fancies such as these, Engrafted in the tenderness of thought, A stranger, linking with the spectacle No conscious memory of a kindred sight, And bringing with me no peculiar sense Of quietness or peace, yet I have stood, Even while mine eye has mov&amp;#39;d o&amp;#39;er three long leagues Of shining water, gathering, as it seem&amp;#39;d, Through every hair-breadth of that field of light, New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers. Thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy Which, through all seasons, on a child&amp;#39;s pursuits Are prompt attendants, &amp;#39;mid that giddy bliss Which, like a tempest, works along the blood And is forgotten; even then I felt Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth And common face of Nature spake to me Rememberable things; sometimes, &amp;#39;tis true, By chance collisions and quaint accidents Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos&amp;#39;d Of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain Nor profitless, if haply they impress&amp;#39;d Collateral objects and appearances, Albeit lifeless then, and doom&amp;#39;d to sleep Until maturer seasons call&amp;#39;d them forth To impregnate and to elevate the mind. —And if the vulgar joy by its own weight Wearied itself out of the memory, The scenes which were a witness of that joy Remained, in their substantial lineaments Depicted on the brain, and to the eye Were visible, a daily sight; and thus By the impressive discipline of fear, By pleasure and repeated happiness, So frequently repeated, and by force Of obscure feelings representative Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes, So beauteous and majestic in themselves, Though yet the day was distant, did at length Become habitually dear, and all Their hues and forms were by invisible links Allied to the affections. I began My story early, feeling as I fear, The weakness of a human love, for days Disown&amp;#39;d by memory, ere the birth of spring Planting my snowdrops among winter snows. Nor will it seem to thee, my Friend! so prompt In sympathy, that I have lengthen&amp;#39;d out, With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale. Meanwhile, my hope has been that I might fetch Invigorating thoughts from former years, Might fix the wavering balance of my mind, And haply meet reproaches, too, whose power May spur me on, in manhood now mature, To honorable toil. Yet should these hopes Be vain, and thus should neither I be taught To understand myself, nor thou to know With better knowledge how the heart was fram&amp;#39;d Of him thou lovest, need I dread from thee Harsh judgments, if I am so loth to quit Those recollected hours that have the charm Of visionary things, and lovely forms And sweet sensations that throw back our life And almost make our Infancy itself A visible scene, on which the sun is shining? One end hereby at least hath been attain&amp;#39;d, My mind hath been revived, and if this mood Desert me not, I will forthwith bring down, Through later years, the story of my life. The road lies plain before me; &amp;#39;tis a theme Single and of determined bounds; and hence I chuse it rather at this time, than work Of ampler or more varied argument.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Thus far, O Friend! have we, though leaving much Unvisited, endeavour&amp;#39;d to retrace My life through its first years, and measured back The way I travell&amp;#39;d when I first began To love the woods and fields; the passion yet Was in its birth, sustain&amp;#39;d, as might befal, By nourishment that came unsought, for still, From week to week, from month to month, we liv&amp;#39;d A round of tumult: duly were our games Prolong&amp;#39;d in summer till the day-light fail&amp;#39;d; No chair remain&amp;#39;d before the doors, the bench And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep The Labourer, and the old Man who had sate, A later lingerer, yet the revelry Continued, and the loud uproar: at last, When all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went, With weary joints, and with a beating mind. Ah! is there one who ever has been young, Nor needs a monitory voice to tame The pride of virtue, and of intellect? And is there one, the wisest and the best Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish For things which cannot be, who would not give, If so he might, to duty and to truth The eagerness of infantine desire? A tranquillizing spirit presses now On my corporeal frame: so wide appears The vacancy between me and those days, Which yet have such self-presence in my mind That, sometimes, when I think of them, I seem Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself And of some other Being. A grey Stone Of native rock, left midway in the Square Of our small market Village, was the home And centre of these joys, and when, return&amp;#39;d After long absence, thither I repair&amp;#39;d, I found that it was split, and gone to build A smart Assembly-room that perk&amp;#39;d and flar&amp;#39;d With wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground Which had been ours. But let the fiddle scream, And be ye happy! yet, my Friends! I know That more than one of you will think with me Of those soft starry nights, and that old Dame From whom the stone was nam&amp;#39;d who there had sate And watch&amp;#39;d her Table with its huckster&amp;#39;s wares Assiduous, thro&amp;#39; the length of sixty years. We ran a boisterous race; the year span round With giddy motion. But the time approach&amp;#39;d That brought with it a regular desire For calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms Of Nature were collaterally attach&amp;#39;d To every scheme of holiday delight, And every boyish sport, less grateful else, And languidly pursued. When summer came It was the pastime of our afternoons To beat along the plain of Windermere With rival oars, and the selected bourne Was now an Island musical with birds That sang for ever; now a Sister Isle Beneath the oaks&amp;#39; umbrageous covert, sown With lillies of the valley, like a field; And now a third small Island where remain&amp;#39;d An old stone Table, and a moulder&amp;#39;d Cave, A Hermit&amp;#39;s history. In such a race, So ended, disappointment could be none, Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy: We rested in the shade, all pleas&amp;#39;d alike, Conquer&amp;#39;d and Conqueror. Thus the pride of strength, And the vain-glory of superior skill Were interfus&amp;#39;d with objects which subdu&amp;#39;d And temper&amp;#39;d them, and gradually produc&amp;#39;d A quiet independence of the heart. And to my Friend, who knows me, I may add, Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence Ensu&amp;#39;d a diffidence and modesty, And I was taught to feel, perhaps too much, The self-sufficing power of solitude. No delicate viands sapp&amp;#39;d our bodily strength; More than we wish&amp;#39;d we knew the blessing then Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals Were frugal, Sabine fare! and then, exclude A little weekly stipend, and we lived Through three divisions of the quarter&amp;#39;d year In pennyless poverty. But now, to School Return&amp;#39;d, from the half-yearly holidays, We came with purses more profusely fill&amp;#39;d, Allowance which abundantly suffic&amp;#39;d To gratify the palate with repasts More costly than the Dame of whom I spake, That ancient Woman, and her board supplied. Hence inroads into distant Vales, and long Excursions far away among the hills, Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground, Or in the woods, or near a river side, Or by some shady fountain, while soft airs Among the leaves were stirring, and the sun Unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy. Nor is my aim neglected, if I tell How twice in the long length of those half-years We from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand Drew largely, anxious for one day, at least, To feel the motion of the galloping Steed; And with the good old Inn-keeper, in truth, On such occasion sometimes we employ&amp;#39;d Sly subterfuge; for the intended bound Of the day&amp;#39;s journey was too distant far For any cautious man, a Structure famed Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique Walls Of that large Abbey which within the vale Of Nightshade, to St. Mary&amp;#39;s honour built, Stands yet, a mouldering Pile, with fractured Arch, Belfry, and Images, and living Trees, A holy Scene! along the smooth green turf Our Horses grazed: to more than inland peace Left by the sea wind passing overhead (Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers May in that Valley oftentimes be seen, Both silent and both motionless alike; Such is the shelter that is there, and such The safeguard for repose and quietness. Our steeds remounted, and the summons given, With whip and spur we by the Chauntry flew In uncouth race, and left the cross-legg&amp;#39;d Knight, And the stone-Abbot, and that single Wren Which one day sang so sweetly in the Nave Of the old Church, that, though from recent showers The earth was comfortless, and, touch&amp;#39;d by faint Internal breezes, sobbings of the place, And respirations, from the roofless walls The shuddering ivy dripp&amp;#39;d large drops, yet still, So sweetly &amp;#39;mid the gloom the invisible Bird Sang to itself, that there I could have made My dwelling-place, and liv&amp;#39;d for ever there To hear such music. Through the Walls we flew And down the valley, and a circuit made In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth We scamper&amp;#39;d homeward. Oh! ye Rocks and Streams, And that still Spirit of the evening air! Even in this joyous time I sometimes felt Your presence, when with slacken&amp;#39;d step we breath&amp;#39;d Along the sides of the steep hills, or when, Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea, We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand. Upon the Eastern Shore of Windermere, Above the crescent of a pleasant Bay, There stood an Inn, no homely-featured Shed, Brother of the surrounding Cottages, But &amp;#39;twas a splendid place, the door beset With Chaises, Grooms, and Liveries, and within Decanters, Glasses, and the blood-red Wine. In ancient times, or ere the Hall was built On the large Island, had this Dwelling been More worthy of a Poet&amp;#39;s love, a Hut, Proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade. But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed The threshold, and large golden characters On the blue-frosted Signboard had usurp&amp;#39;d The place of the old Lion, in contempt And mockery of the rustic painter&amp;#39;s hand, Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear With all its foolish pomp. The garden lay Upon a slope surmounted by the plain Of a small Bowling-green; beneath us stood A grove; with gleams of water through the trees And over the tree-tops; nor did we want Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream. And there, through half an afternoon, we play&amp;#39;d On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent Made all the mountains ring. But ere the fall Of night, when in our pinnace we return&amp;#39;d Over the dusky Lake, and to the beach Of some small Island steer&amp;#39;d our course with one, The Minstrel of our troop, and left him there, And row&amp;#39;d off gently, while he blew his flute Alone upon the rock; Oh! then the calm And dead still water lay upon my mind Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky Never before so beautiful, sank down Into my heart, and held me like a dream. Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged, And thus the common range of visible things Grew dear to me: already I began To love the sun, a Boy I lov&amp;#39;d the sun, Not as I since have lov&amp;#39;d him, as a pledge And surety of our earthly life, a light Which while we view we feel we are alive; But, for this cause, that I had seen him lay His beauty on the morning hills, had seen The western mountain touch his setting orb, In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess Of happiness, my blood appear&amp;#39;d to flow With its own pleasure, and I breath&amp;#39;d with joy. And from like feelings, humble though intense, To patriotic and domestic love Analogous, the moon to me was dear; For I would dream away my purposes, Standing to look upon her while she hung Midway between the hills, as if she knew No other region; but belong&amp;#39;d to thee, Yea, appertain&amp;#39;d by a peculiar right To thee and thy grey huts, my darling Vale! Those incidental charms which first attach&amp;#39;d My heart to rural objects, day by day Grew weaker, and I hasten on to tell How Nature, intervenient till this time, And secondary, now at length was sought For her own sake. But who shall parcel out His intellect, by geometric rules, Split, like a province, into round and square? Who knows the individual hour in which His habits were first sown, even as a seed, Who that shall point, as with a wand, and say, &amp;#39;This portion of the river of my mind Came from yon fountain?&amp;#39; Thou, my Friend! art one More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee Science appears but, what in truth she is, Not as our glory and our absolute boast, But as a succedaneum, and a prop To our infirmity. Thou art no slave Of that false secondary power, by which, In weakness, we create distinctions, then Deem that our puny boundaries are things Which we perceive, and not which we have made. To thee, unblinded by these outward shows, The unity of all has been reveal&amp;#39;d And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill&amp;#39;d Than many are to class the cabinet Of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase, Run through the history and birth of each, As of a single independent thing. Hard task to analyse a soul, in which, Not only general habits and desires, But each most obvious and particular thought, Not in a mystical and idle sense, But in the words of reason deeply weigh&amp;#39;d, Hath no beginning. Bless&amp;#39;d the infant Babe, (For with my best conjectures I would trace The progress of our Being) blest the Babe, Nurs&amp;#39;d in his Mother&amp;#39;s arms, the Babe who sleeps Upon his Mother&amp;#39;s breast, who, when his soul Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul, Doth gather passion from his Mother&amp;#39;s eye! Such feelings pass into his torpid life Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind Even [in the first trial of its powers] Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine In one appearance, all the elements And parts of the same object, else detach&amp;#39;d And loth to coalesce. Thus, day by day, Subjected to the discipline of love, His organs and recipient faculties Are quicken&amp;#39;d, are more vigorous, his mind spreads, Tenacious of the forms which it receives. In one beloved presence, nay and more, In that most apprehensive habitude And those sensations which have been deriv&amp;#39;d From this beloved Presence, there exists A virtue which irradiates and exalts All objects through all intercourse of sense. No outcast he, bewilder&amp;#39;d and depress&amp;#39;d; Along his infant veins are interfus&amp;#39;d The gravitation and the filial bond Of nature, that connect him with the world. Emphatically such a Being lives, An inmate of this active universe; From nature largely he receives; nor so Is satisfied, but largely gives again, For feeling has to him imparted strength, And powerful in all sentiments of grief, Of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind, Even as an agent of the one great mind, Creates, creator and receiver both, Working but in alliance with the works Which it beholds.—Such, verily, is the first Poetic spirit of our human life; By uniform control of after years In most abated or suppress&amp;#39;d, in some, Through every change of growth or of decay, Pre-eminent till death. From early days, Beginning not long after that first time In which, a Babe, by intercourse of touch, I held mute dialogues with my Mother&amp;#39;s heart I have endeavour&amp;#39;d to display the means Whereby this infant sensibility, Great birthright of our Being, was in me Augmented and sustain&amp;#39;d. Yet is a path More difficult before me, and I fear That in its broken windings we shall need The chamois&amp;#39; sinews, and the eagle&amp;#39;s wing: For now a trouble came into my mind From unknown causes. I was left alone, Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why. The props of my affections were remov&amp;#39;d, And yet the building stood, as if sustain&amp;#39;d By its own spirit! All that I beheld Was dear to me, and from this cause it came, That now to Nature&amp;#39;s finer influxes My mind lay open, to that more exact And intimate communion which our hearts Maintain with the minuter properties Of objects which already are belov&amp;#39;d, And of those only. Many are the joys Of youth; but oh! what happiness to live When every hour brings palpable access Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight, And sorrow is not there. The seasons came, And every season to my notice brought A store of transitory qualities Which, but for this most watchful power of love Had been neglected, left a register Of permanent relations, else unknown, Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude More active, even, than &amp;#39;best society&amp;#39;, Society made sweet as solitude By silent inobtrusive sympathies, And gentle agitations of the mind From manifold distinctions, difference Perceived in things, where to the common eye, No difference is; and hence, from the same source Sublimer joy; for I would walk alone, In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights Beneath the quiet Heavens; and, at that time, Have felt whate&amp;#39;er there is of power in sound To breathe an elevated mood, by form Or image unprofaned; and I would stand, Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are The ghostly language of the ancient earth, Or make their dim abode in distant winds. Thence did I drink the visionary power. I deem not profitless those fleeting moods Of shadowy exultation: not for this, That they are kindred to our purer mind And intellectual life; but that the soul, Remembering how she felt, but what she felt Remembering not, retains an obscure sense Of possible sublimity, to which, With growing faculties she doth aspire, With faculties still growing, feeling still That whatsoever point they gain, they still Have something to pursue. And not alone, In grandeur and in tumult, but no less In tranquil scenes, that universal power And fitness in the latent qualities And essences of things, by which the mind Is mov&amp;#39;d by feelings of delight, to me Came strengthen&amp;#39;d with a superadded soul, A virtue not its own. My morning walks Were early; oft, before the hours of School I travell&amp;#39;d round our little Lake, five miles Of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear For this, that one was by my side, a Friend Then passionately lov&amp;#39;d; with heart how full Will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps A blank to other men! for many years Have since flow&amp;#39;d in between us; and our minds, Both silent to each other, at this time We live as if those hours had never been. Nor seldom did I lift our cottage latch Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush Was audible, among the hills I sate Alone, upon some jutting eminence At the first hour of morning, when the Vale Lay quiet in an utter solitude. How shall I trace the history, where seek The origin of what I then have felt? Oft in these moments such a holy calm Did overspread my soul, that I forgot That I had bodily eyes, and what I saw Appear&amp;#39;d like something in myself, a dream, A prospect in my mind. &amp;#39;Twere long to tell What spring and autumn, what the winter snows, And what the summer shade, what day and night, The evening and the morning, what my dreams And what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse That spirit of religious love in which I walked with Nature. But let this, at least Be not forgotten, that I still retain&amp;#39;d My first creative sensibility, That by the regular action of the world My soul was unsubdu&amp;#39;d. A plastic power Abode with me, a forming hand, at times Rebellious, acting in a devious mood, A local spirit of its own, at war With general tendency, but for the most Subservient strictly to the external things With which it commun&amp;#39;d. An auxiliar light Came from my mind which on the setting sun Bestow&amp;#39;d new splendor, the melodious birds, The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on, Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey&amp;#39;d A like dominion; and the midnight storm Grew darker in the presence of my eye. Hence by obeisance, my devotion hence, And hence my transport. Nor should this, perchance, Pass unrecorded, that I still have lov&amp;#39;d The exercise and produce of a toil Than analytic industry to me More pleasing, and whose character I deem Is more poetic as resembling more Creative agency. I mean to speak Of that interminable building rear&amp;#39;d By observation of affinities In objects where no brotherhood exists To common minds. My seventeenth year was come And, whether from this habit, rooted now So deeply in my mind, or from excess Of the great social principle of life, Coercing all things into sympathy, To unorganic natures I transferr&amp;#39;d My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth Coming in revelation, I convers&amp;#39;d With things that really are, I, at this time Saw blessings spread around me like a sea. Thus did my days pass on, and now at length From Nature and her overflowing soul I had receiv&amp;#39;d so much that all my thoughts Were steep&amp;#39;d in feeling; I was only then Contented when with bliss ineffable I felt the sentiment of Being spread O&amp;#39;er all that moves, and all that seemeth still, O&amp;#39;er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought And human knowledge, to the human eye Invisible, yet liveth to the heart, O&amp;#39;er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings, Or beats the gladsome air, o&amp;#39;er all that glides Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself And mighty depth of waters. Wonder not If such my transports were; for in all things I saw one life, and felt that it was joy. One song they sang, and it was audible, Most audible then when the fleshly ear, O&amp;#39;ercome by grosser prelude of that strain, Forgot its functions, and slept undisturb&amp;#39;d. If this be error, and another faith Find easier access to the pious mind, Yet were I grossly destitute of all Those human sentiments which make this earth So dear, if I should fail, with grateful voice To speak of you, Ye Mountains and Ye Lakes, And sounding Cataracts! Ye Mists and Winds That dwell among the hills where I was born. If, in my youth, I have been pure in heart, If, mingling with the world, I am content With my own modest pleasures, and have liv&amp;#39;d, With God and Nature communing, remov&amp;#39;d From little enmities and low desires, The gift is yours; if in these times of fear, This melancholy waste of hopes o&amp;#39;erthrown, If, &amp;#39;mid indifference and apathy And wicked exultation, when good men, On every side fall off we know not how, To selfishness, disguis&amp;#39;d in gentle names Of peace, and quiet, and domestic love, Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers On visionary minds; if in this time Of dereliction and dismay, I yet Despair not of our nature; but retain A more than Roman confidence, a faith That fails not, in all sorrow my support, The blessing of my life, the gift is yours, Ye mountains! thine, O Nature! Thou hast fed My lofty speculations; and in thee, For this uneasy heart of ours I find A never-failing principle of joy, And purest passion. Thou, my Friend! wert rear&amp;#39;d In the great City, &amp;#39;mid far other scenes; But we, by different roads at length have gain&amp;#39;d The self-same bourne. And for this cause to Thee I speak, unapprehensive of contempt, The insinuated scoff of coward tongues, And all that silent language which so oft In conversation betwixt man and man Blots from the human countenance all trace Of beauty and of love. For Thou hast sought The truth in solitude, and Thou art one, The most intense of Nature&amp;#39;s worshippers In many things my Brother, chiefly here In this my deep devotion. Fare Thee well! Health, and the quiet of a healthful mind Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men, And yet more often living with Thyself, And for Thyself, so haply shall thy days Be many, and a blessing to mankind.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;There was a roaring in the wind all night; The rain came heavily and fell in floods; But now the sun is rising calm and bright; The birds are singing in the distant woods; Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods; The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters; And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters. All things that love the sun are out of doors; The sky rejoices in the morning\&amp;#39;s birth; The grass is bright with rain-drops;—on the moors The hare is running races in her mirth; And with her feet she from the plashy earth Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun, Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run. I was a Traveller then upon the moor; I saw the hare that raced about with joy; I heard the woods and distant waters roar; Or heard them not, as happy as a boy: The pleasant season did my heart employ: My old remembrances went from me wholly; And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy. But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might Of joys in minds that can no further go, As high as we have mounted in delight In our dejection do we sink as low; To me that morning did it happen so; And fears and fancies thick upon me came; Dim sadness—and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name. I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky; And I bethought me of the playful hare: Even such a happy Child of earth am I; Even as these blissful creatures do I fare; Far from the world I walk, and from all care; But there may come another day to me— Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty. My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought, As if life\&amp;#39;s business were a summer mood; As if all needful things would come unsought To genial faith, still rich in genial good; But how can He expect that others should Build for him, sow for him, and at his call Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all? I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy, The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride; Of Him who walked in glory and in joy Following his plough, along the mountain-side: By our own spirits are we deified: We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; But thereof come in the end despondency and madness. Now, whether it were by peculiar grace, A leading from above, a something given, Yet it befell that, in this lonely place, When I with these untoward thoughts had striven, Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven I saw a Man before me unawares: The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs. As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie Couched on the bald top of an eminence; Wonder to all who do the same espy, By what means it could thither come, and whence; So that it seems a thing endued with sense: Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself; Such seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead, Nor all asleep—in his extreme old age: His body was bent double, feet and head Coming together in life\&amp;#39;s pilgrimage; As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage Of sickness felt by him in times long past, A more than human weight upon his frame had cast. Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood: And, still as I drew near with gentle pace, Upon the margin of that moorish flood Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood, That heareth not the loud winds when they call, And moveth all together, if it move at all. At length, himself unsettling, he the pond Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look Upon the muddy water, which he conned, As if he had been reading in a book: And now a stranger\&amp;#39;s privilege I took; And, drawing to his side, to him did say, &amp;quot;This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.&amp;quot; A gentle answer did the old Man make, In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: And him with further words I thus bespake, &amp;quot;What occupation do you there pursue? This is a lonesome place for one like you.&amp;quot; Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes. His words came feebly, from a feeble chest, But each in solemn order followed each, With something of a lofty utterance drest— Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach Of ordinary men; a stately speech; Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use, Religious men, who give to God and man their dues. He told, that to these waters he had come To gather leeches, being old and poor: Employment hazardous and wearisome! And he had many hardships to endure: From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor; Housing, with God\&amp;#39;s good help, by choice or chance; And in this way he gained an honest maintenance. The old Man still stood talking by my side; But now his voice to me was like a stream Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide; And the whole body of the Man did seem Like one whom I had met with in a dream; Or like a man from some far region sent, To give me human strength, by apt admonishment. My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills; And hope that is unwilling to be fed; Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills; And mighty Poets in their misery dead. —Perplexed, and longing to be comforted, My question eagerly did I renew, &amp;quot;How is it that you live, and what is it you do?&amp;quot; He with a smile did then his words repeat; And said that, gathering leeches, far and wide He travelled; stirring thus about his feet The waters of the pools where they abide. &amp;quot;Once I could meet with them on every side; But they have dwindled long by slow decay; Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may.&amp;quot; While he was talking thus, the lonely place, The old Man\&amp;#39;s shape, and speech—all troubled me: In my mind\&amp;#39;s eye I seemed to see him pace About the weary moors continually, Wandering about alone and silently. While I these thoughts within myself pursued, He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed. And soon with this he other matter blended, Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind, But stately in the main; and, when he ended, I could have laughed myself to scorn to find In that decrepit Man so firm a mind. &amp;quot;God,&amp;quot; said I, &amp;quot;be my help and stay secure; I\&amp;#39;ll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;At the corner of Wood Street, when daylight appears, Hangs a Thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years: Poor Susan has passed by the spot, and has heard In the silence of morning the song of the Bird. &amp;#39;Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? She sees A mountain ascending, a vision of trees; Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide, And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside. Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale, Down which she so often has tripped with her pail; And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove&amp;#39;s, The one only dwelling on earth that she loves. She looks, and her heart is in heaven: but they fade, The mist and the river, the hill and the shade: The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise, And the colours have all passed away from her eyes!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Scorn not the Sonnet; Critic, you have frowned, Mindless of its just honours; with this key Shakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch&amp;#39;s wound; A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound; With it Camöens soothed an exile&amp;#39;s grief; The Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp, It cheered mild Spenser, called from Faery-land To struggle through dark ways; and, when a damp Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand The Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew Soul-animating strains—alas, too few!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Departing summer hath assumed An aspect tenderly illumed, The gentlest look of spring; That calls from yonder leafy shade Unfaded, yet prepared to fade, A timely carolling. No faint and hesitating trill, Such tribute as to winter chill The lonely redbreast pays! Clear, loud, and lively is the din, From social warblers gathering in Their harvest of sweet lays. Nor doth the example fail to cheer Me, conscious that my leaf is sere, And yellow on the bough:— Fall, rosy garlands, from my head! Ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance shed Around a younger brow! Yet will I temperately rejoice; Wide is the range, and free the choice Of undiscordant themes; Which, haply, kindred souls may prize Not less than vernal ecstasies, And passion&amp;#39;s feverish dreams. For deathless powers to verse belong, And they like Demi-gods are strong On whom the Muses smile; But some their function have disclaimed, Best pleased with what is aptliest framed To enervate and defile. Not such the initiatory strains Committed to the silent plains In Britain&amp;#39;s earliest dawn: Trembled the groves, the stars grew pale, While all-too-daringly the veil Of nature was withdrawn! Nor such the spirit-stirring note When the live chords Alcæus smote, Inflamed by sense of wrong; Woe! woe to Tyrants! from the lyre Broke threateningly, in sparkles dire Of fierce vindictive song. And not unhallowed was the page By wingèd Love inscribed, to assuage The pangs of vain pursuit; Love listening while the Lesbian Maid With finest touch of passion swayed Her own Æolian lute. O ye, who patiently explore The wreck of Herculanean lore, What rapture! could ye seize Some Theban fragment, or unroll One precious, tender-hearted scroll Of pure Simonides. That were, indeed, a genuine birth Of poesy; a bursting forth Of genius from the dust: What Horace gloried to behold, What Maro loved, shall we enfold? Can haughty Time be just!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;She dwelt among the untrodden ways Beside the springs of Dove, A Maid whom there were none to praise And very few to love: A violet by a mossy stone Half hidden from the eye! —Fair as a star, when only one Is shining in the sky. She lived unknown, and few could know When Lucy ceased to be; But she is in her grave, and, oh, The difference to me!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;She was a Phantom of delight When first she gleamed upon my sight; A lovely Apparition, sent To be a moment&amp;#39;s ornament; Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair; Like Twilight&amp;#39;s, too, her dusky hair; But all things else about her drawn From May-time and the cheerful Dawn; A dancing Shape, an Image gay, To haunt, to startle, and way-lay. I saw her upon nearer view, A Spirit, yet a Woman too! Her household motions light and free, And steps of virgin-liberty; A countenance in which did meet Sweet records, promises as sweet; A Creature not too bright or good For human nature&amp;#39;s daily food; For transient sorrows, simple wiles, Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles. And now I see with eye serene The very pulse of the machine; A Being breathing thoughtful breath, A Traveller between life and death; The reason firm, the temperate will, Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill; A perfect Woman, nobly planned, To warn, to comfort, and command; And yet a Spirit still, and bright With something of angelic light.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;In the sweet shire of Cardigan, Not far from pleasant Ivor-hall, An old Man dwells, a little man,— \&amp;#39;Tis said he once was tall. For five-and-thirty years he lived A running huntsman merry; And still the centre of his cheek Is red as a ripe cherry. No man like him the horn could sound, And hill and valley rang with glee When Echo bandied, round and round The halloo of Simon Lee. In those proud days, he little cared For husbandry or tillage; To blither tasks did Simon rouse The sleepers of the village. He all the country could outrun, Could leave both man and horse behind; And often, ere the chase was done, He reeled, and was stone-blind. And still there\&amp;#39;s something in the world At which his heart rejoices; For when the chiming hounds are out, He dearly loves their voices! But, oh the heavy change!—bereft Of health, strength, friends, and kindred, see! Old Simon to the world is left In liveried poverty. His Master\&amp;#39;s dead—and no one now Dwells in the Hall of Ivor; Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead; He is the sole survivor. And he is lean and he is sick; His body, dwindled and awry, Rests upon ankles swoln and thick; His legs are thin and dry. One prop he has, and only one, His wife, an aged woman, Lives with him, near the waterfall, Upon the village Common. Beside their moss-grown hut of clay, Not twenty paces from the door, A scrap of land they have, but they Are poorest of the poor. This scrap of land he from the heath Enclosed when he was stronger; But what to them avails the land Which he can till no longer? Oft, working by her Husband\&amp;#39;s side, Ruth does what Simon cannot do; For she, with scanty cause for pride, Is stouter of the two. And, though you with your utmost skill From labour could not wean them, \&amp;#39;Tis little, very little—all That they can do between them. Few months of life has he in store As he to you will tell, For still, the more he works, the more Do his weak ankles swell. My gentle Reader, I perceive, How patiently you\&amp;#39;ve waited, And now I fear that you expect Some tale will be related. O Reader! had you in your mind Such stores as silent thought can bring, O gentle Reader! you would find A tale in every thing. What more I have to say is short, And you must kindly take it: It is no tale; but, should you think, Perhaps a tale you\&amp;#39;ll make it. One summer-day I chanced to see This old Man doing all he could To unearth the root of an old tree, A stump of rotten wood. The mattock tottered in his hand; So vain was his endeavour, That at the root of the old tree He might have worked for ever. &amp;quot;You\&amp;#39;re overtasked, good Simon Lee, Give me your tool,&amp;quot; to him I said; And at the word right gladly he Received my proffered aid. I struck, and with a single blow The tangled root I severed, At which the poor old Man so long And vainly had endeavoured. The tears into his eyes were brought, And thanks and praises seemed to run So fast out of his heart, I thought They never would have done. —I\&amp;#39;ve heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds With coldness still returning; Alas! the gratitude of men Hath oftener left me mourning.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;—Brook and roadWere fellow-travellers in this gloomy Pass,And with them did we journey several hoursAt a slow step. The immeasurable heightOf woods decaying, never to be decayed,The stationary blasts of waterfalls,And in the narrow rent, at every turn,Winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn,The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky,The rocks that muttered close upon our ears,Black drizzling crags that spake by the waysideAs if a voice were in them, the sick sightAnd giddy prospect of the raving stream,The unfettered clouds and region of the heavens,Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light—Were all like workings of one mind, the featuresOf the same face, blossoms upon one tree,Characters of the great Apocalypse,The types and symbols of Eternity,Of first and last, and midst, and without end.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;A slumber did my spirit seal; I had no human fears: She seemed a thing that could not feel The touch of earthly years. No motion has she now, no force; She neither hears nor sees; Rolled round in earth&amp;#39;s diurnal course, With rocks, and stones, and trees.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Behold her, single in the field, Yon solitary Highland Lass! Reaping and singing by herself; Stop here, or gently pass! Alone she cuts and binds the grain, And sings a melancholy strain; O listen! for the Vale profound Is overflowing with the sound. No Nightingale did ever chaunt More welcome notes to weary bands Of travellers in some shady haunt, Among Arabian sands: A voice so thrilling ne&amp;#39;er was heard In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird, Breaking the silence of the seas Among the farthest Hebrides. Will no one tell me what she sings?— Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow For old, unhappy, far-off things, And battles long ago: Or is it some more humble lay, Familiar matter of to-day? Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain, That has been, and may be again? Whate&amp;#39;er the theme, the Maiden sang As if her song could have no ending; I saw her singing at her work, And o&amp;#39;er the sickle bending;— I listened, motionless and still; And, as I mounted up the hill, The music in my heart I bore, Long after it was heard no more.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;High in the breathless Hall the Minstrel sate, And Emont\&amp;#39;s murmur mingled with the Song.— The words of ancient time I thus translate, A festal strain that hath been silent long:— &amp;quot;From town to town, from tower to tower, The red rose is a gladsome flower. Her thirty years of winter past, The red rose is revived at last; She lifts her head for endless spring, For everlasting blossoming: Both roses flourish, red and white: In love and sisterly delight The two that were at strife are blended, And all old troubles now are ended.— Joy! joy to both! but most to her Who is the flower of Lancaster! Behold her how She smiles to-day On this great throng, this bright array! Fair greeting doth she send to all From every corner of the hall; But chiefly from above the board Where sits in state our rightful Lord, A Clifford to his own restored! &amp;quot;They came with banner, spear, and shield; And it was proved in Bosworth-field. Not long the Avenger was withstood— Earth helped him with the cry of blood: St. George was for us, and the might Of blessed Angels crowned the right. Loud voice the Land has uttered forth, We loudest in the faithful north: Our fields rejoice, our mountains ring, Our streams proclaim a welcoming; Our strong-abodes and castles see The glory of their loyalty. &amp;quot;How glad is Skipton at this hour— Though lonely, a deserted Tower; Knight, squire, and yeoman, page and groom, We have them at the feast of Brough\&amp;#39;m. How glad Pendragon—though the sleep Of years be on her!—She shall reap A taste of this great pleasure, viewing As in a dream her own renewing. Rejoiced is Brough, right glad, I deem, Beside her little humble stream; And she that keepeth watch and ward Her statelier Eden\&amp;#39;s course to guard; They both are happy at this hour, Though each is but a lonely Tower:— But here is perfect joy and pride For one fair House by Emont\&amp;#39;s side, This day, distinguished without peer, To see her Master and to cheer— Him, and his Lady-mother dear! &amp;quot;Oh! it was a time forlorn When the fatherless was born— Give her wings that she may fly, Or she sees her infant die! Swords that are with slaughter wild Hunt the Mother and the Child. Who will take them from the light? —Yonder is a man in sight— Yonder is a house—but where? No, they must not enter there. To the caves, and to the brooks, To the clouds of heaven she looks; She is speechless, but her eyes Pray in ghostly agonies. Blissful Mary, Mother mild, Maid and Mother undefiled, Save a Mother and her Child! &amp;quot;Now who is he that bounds with joy On Carrock\&amp;#39;s side, a Shepherd-boy? No thoughts hath he but thoughts that pass Light as the wind along the grass. Can this be He who hither came In secret, like a smothered flame? O\&amp;#39;er whom such thankful tears were shed For shelter, and a poor man\&amp;#39;s bread! God loves the Child; and God hath willed That those dear words should be fulfilled, The Lady\&amp;#39;s words, when forced away The last she to her Babe did say: &amp;quot;My own, my own, thy fellow-guest I may not be; but rest thee, rest, For lowly shepherd\&amp;#39;s life is best!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Alas! when evil men are strong No life is good, no pleasure long. The Boy must part from Mosedale\&amp;#39;s groves, And leave Blencathara\&amp;#39;s rugged coves, And quit the flowers that summer brings To Glenderamakin\&amp;#39;s lofty springs; Must vanish, and his careless cheer Be turned to heaviness and fear. —Give Sir Lancelot Threlkeld praise! Hear it, good man, old in days! Thou tree of covert and of rest For this young Bird that is distrest; Among thy branches safe he lay, And he was free to sport and play, When falcons were abroad for prey. &amp;quot;A recreant harp, that sings of fear And heaviness in Clifford\&amp;#39;s ear! I said, when evil men are strong, No life is good, no pleasure long, A weak and cowardly untruth! Our Clifford was a happy Youth, And thankful through a weary time, That brought him up to manhood\&amp;#39;s prime. —Again he wanders forth at will, And tends a flock from hill to hill: His garb is humble; ne\&amp;#39;er was seen Such garb with such a noble mien; Among the shepherd-grooms no mate Hath he, a Child of strength and state! Yet lacks not friends for simple glee, Nor yet for higher sympathy. To his side the fallow-deer Came and rested without fear; The eagle, lord of land and sea, Stooped down to pay him fealty; And both the undying fish that swim Through Bowscale-tarn did wait on him; The pair were servants of his eye In their immortality; And glancing, gleaming, dark or bright, Moved to and fro, for his delight. He knew the rocks which Angels haunt Upon the mountains visitant; He hath kenned them taking wing: And into caves where Faeries sing He hath entered; and been told By Voices how men lived of old. Among the heavens his eye can see The face of thing that is to be; And, if that men report him right, His tongue could whisper words of might. —Now another day is come, Fitter hope, and nobler doom; He hath thrown aside his crook, And hath buried deep his book; Armour rusting in his halls On the blood of Clifford calls,— \&amp;#39;Quell the Scot,\&amp;#39; exclaims the Lance— Bear me to the heart of France, Is the longing of the Shield— Tell thy name, thou trembling field; Field of death, where\&amp;#39;er thou be, Groan thou with our victory! Happy day, and mighty hour, When our Shepherd, in his power, Mailed and horsed, with lance and sword, To his ancestors restored Like a re-appearing Star, Like a glory from afar First shall head the flock of war!&amp;quot; Alas! the impassioned minstrel did not know How, by Heaven\&amp;#39;s grace, this Clifford\&amp;#39;s heart was framed: How he, long forced in humble walks to go, Was softened into feeling, soothed, and tamed. Love had he found in huts where poor men lie; His daily teachers had been woods and rills, The silence that is in the starry sky, The sleep that is among the lonely hills. In him the savage virtue of the Race, Revenge and all ferocious thoughts were dead: Nor did he change; but kept in lofty place The wisdom which adversity had bred. Glad were the vales, and every cottage-hearth; The Shepherd-lord was honoured more and more; And, ages after he was laid in earth, &amp;quot;The good Lord Clifford&amp;quot; was the name he bore.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I thought of Thee, my partner and my guide,As being past away.—Vain sympathies!For, backward, Duddon! as I cast my eyes,I see what was, and is, and will abide;Still glides the Stream, and shall for ever glide;The Form remains, the Function never dies;While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise,We Men, who in our morn of youth defiedThe elements, must vanish;—be it so!Enough, if something from our hands have powerTo live, and act, and serve the future hour;And if, as toward the silent tomb we go,Through love, through hope, and faith&amp;#39;s transcendent dower,We feel that we are greater than we know.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Surprised by joy—impatient as the Wind I turned to share the transport—Oh! with whom But Thee, long buried in the silent Tomb, That spot which no vicissitude can find? Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind— But how could I forget thee?—Through what power, Even for the least division of an hour, Have I been so beguiled as to be blind To my most grievous loss!—That thought’s return Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore, Save one, one only, when I stood forlorn, Knowing my heart’s best treasure was no more; That neither present time, nor years unborn Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Up! up! my Friend, and quit your books; Or surely you&amp;#39;ll grow double: Up! up! my Friend, and clear your looks; Why all this toil and trouble? The sun above the mountain&amp;#39;s head, A freshening lustre mellow Through all the long green fields has spread, His first sweet evening yellow. Books! &amp;#39;tis a dull and endless strife: Come, hear the woodland linnet, How sweet his music! on my life, There&amp;#39;s more of wisdom in it. And hark! how blithe the throstle sings! He, too, is no mean preacher: Come forth into the light of things, Let Nature be your teacher. She has a world of ready wealth, Our minds and hearts to bless— Spontaneous wisdom breathed by health, Truth breathed by cheerfulness. One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can. Sweet is the lore which Nature brings; Our meddling intellect Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:— We murder to dissect. Enough of Science and of Art; Close up those barren leaves; Come forth, and bring with you a heart That watches and receives.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;There was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs And islands of Winander! many a time, At evening, when the earliest stars began To move along the edges of the hills, Rising or setting, would he stand alone, Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake; And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth Uplifted, he, as through an instrument, Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls That they might answer him.—And they would shout Across the watery vale, and shout again, Responsive to his call,—with quivering peals, And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild Of jocund din! And, when there came a pause Of silence such as baffled his best skill: Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise Has carried far into his heart the voice Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene Would enter unawares into his mind With all its solemn imagery, its rocks, Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received Into the bosom of the steady lake. This boy was taken from his mates, and died In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old. Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale Where he was born and bred: the churchyard hangs Upon a slope above the village-school; And through that churchyard when my way has led On summer-evenings, I believe that there A long half-hour together I have stood Mute—looking at the grave in which he lies!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I“There is a Thorn—it looks so old,In truth, you’d find it hard to sayHow it could ever have been young,It looks so old and grey.Not higher than a two years&amp;#39; childIt stands erect, this aged Thorn;No leaves it has, no prickly points;It is a mass of knotted joints,A wretched thing forlorn.It stands erect, and like a stoneWith lichens is it overgrown. II“Like rock or stone, it is o’ergrown,With lichens to the very top,And hung with heavy tufts of moss,A melancholy crop:Up from the earth these mosses creep,And this poor Thorn they clasp it roundSo close, you’d say that they are bentWith plain and manifest intentTo drag it to the ground;And all have joined in one endeavourTo bury this poor Thorn for ever. III“High on a mountain’s highest ridge,Where oft the stormy winter galeCuts like a scythe, while through the cloudsIt sweeps from vale to vale;Not five yards from the mountain path,This Thorn you on your left espy;And to the left, three yards beyond,You see a little muddy pondOf water—never dry,Though but of compass small, and bareTo thirsty suns and parching air. IV“And, close beside this aged Thorn,There is a fresh and lovely sight,A beauteous heap, a hill of moss,Just half a foot in height.All lovely colours there you see,All colours that were ever seen;And mossy network too is there,As if by hand of lady fairThe work had woven been;And cups, the darlings of the eye,So deep is their vermilion dye. V“Ah me! what lovely tints are thereOf olive green and scarlet bright,In spikes, in branches, and in stars,Green, red, and pearly white!This heap of earth o’ergrown with moss,Which close beside the Thorn you see,So fresh in all its beauteous dyes,Is like an infant’s grave in size,As like as like can be:But never, never any where,An infant’s grave was half so fair. VI“Now would you see this aged Thorn,This pond, and beauteous hill of moss,You must take care and choose your timeThe mountain when to cross.For oft there sits between the heap,So like an infant’s grave in size,And that same pond of which I spoke,A Woman in a scarlet cloak,And to herself she cries,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!Oh woe is me! oh misery!’\ufeff VII“At all times of the day and nightThis wretched Woman thither goes;And she is known to every star,And every wind that blows;And there, beside the Thorn, she sitsWhen the blue daylight’s in the skies,And when the whirlwind’s on the hill,Or frosty air is keen and still,And to herself she cries,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!Oh woe is me! oh misery!’ ” VIII“Now wherefore, thus, by day and night,In rain, in tempest, and in snow,Thus to the dreary mountain-topDoes this poor Woman go?And why sits she beside the ThornWhen the blue daylight’s in the skyOr when the whirlwind’s on the hill,Or frosty air is keen and still,And wherefore does she cry?—O wherefore? wherefore? tell me whyDoes she repeat that doleful cry?” IX“I cannot tell; I wish I could;For the true reason no one knows:But would you gladly view the spot,The spot to which she goes;The hillock like an infant’s grave,The pond—and Thorn, so old and grey;Pass by her door—’tis seldom shut—And if you see her in her hut—Then to the spot away!I never heard of such as dareApproach the spot when she is there.” X“But wherefore to the mountain-topCan this unhappy Woman go,Whatever star is in the skies,Whatever wind may blow?”“Full twenty years are past and goneSince she (her name is Martha Ray)Gave with a maiden’s true good-willHer company to Stephen Hill;And she was blithe and gay,While friends and kindred all approvedOf him whom tenderly she loved. XI“And they had fixed the wedding day,The morning that must wed them both;But Stephen to another MaidHad sworn another oath;And, with this other Maid, to churchUnthinking Stephen went— Poor Martha! on that woeful dayA pang of pitiless dismayInto her soul was sent;A fire was kindled in her breast,Which might not burn itself to rest. XII“They say, full six months after this,While yet the summer leaves were green,She to the mountain-top would go,And there was often seen.What could she seek?—or wish to hide?Her state to any eye was plain;She was with child, and she was mad;Yet often was she sober sadFrom her exceeding pain.O guilty Father—would that deathHad saved him from that breach of faith! XIII“Sad case for such a brain to holdCommunion with a stirring child!Sad case, as you may think, for oneWho had a brain so wild!Last Christmas-eve we talked of this,And grey-haired Wilfred of the glenHeld that the unborn infant wroughtAbout its mother’s heart, and broughtHer senses back again:And, when at last her time drew near,Her looks were calm, her senses clear. XIV“More know I not, I wish I did,And it should all be told to you;For what became of this poor childNo mortal ever knew;Nay—if a child to her was bornNo earthly tongue could ever tell;And if ’twas born alive or dead,Far less could this with proof be said;But some remember well,That Martha Ray about this timeWould up the mountain often climb. XV“And all that winter, when at nightThe wind blew from the mountain-peak,’Twas worth your while, though in the dark,The churchyard path to seek:For many a time and oft were heardCries coming from the mountain head:Some plainly living voices were;And others, I’ve heard many swear,Were voices of the dead:I cannot think, whate’er they say,They had to do with Martha Ray. XVI“But that she goes to this old Thorn,The Thorn which I described to you,And there sits in a scarlet cloak,I will be sworn is true.For one day with my telescope,To view the ocean wide and bright,When to this country first I came,Ere I had heard of Martha’s name,I climbed the mountain’s height:—A storm came on, and I could seeNo object higher than my knee. XVII“ ’Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain:No screen, no fence could I discover;And then the wind! in sooth, it wasA wind full ten times over.I looked around, I thought I sawA jutting crag,—and off I ran,Head-foremost, through the driving rain,The shelter of the crag to gain;And, as I am a man,Instead of jutting crag, I foundA Woman seated on the ground. XVIII“I did not speak—I saw her face;Her face!—it was enough for me;I turned about and heard her cry,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!’\ufeffAnd there she sits, until the moonThrough half the clear blue sky will go;And when the little breezes makeThe waters of the pond to shake,As all the country know,She shudders, and you hear her cry,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!’ ” XIX“But what’s the Thorn? and what the pond?And what the hill of moss to her?And what the creeping breeze that comesThe little pond to stir?”“I cannot tell; but some will sayShe hanged her baby on the tree;Some say she drowned it in the pond,Which is a little step beyond:But all and each agree,The little Babe was buried there,Beneath that hill of moss so fair. XX“I’ve heard, the moss is spotted redWith drops of that poor infant’s blood;But kill a new-born infant thus,I do not think she could!Some say, if to the pond you go,And fix on it a steady view,The shadow of a babe you trace,A baby and a baby’s face,And that it looks at you;Whene’er you look on it, ’tis plainThe baby looks at you again. XXI“And some had sworn an oath that sheShould be to public justice brought;And for the little infant’s bonesWith spades they would have sought.But instantly the hill of mossBefore their eyes began to stir!And, for full fifty yards around,The grass—it shook upon the ground!Yet all do still averThe little Babe lies buried there,Beneath that hill of moss so fair. XXII“I cannot tell how this may be,But plain it is the Thorn is boundWith heavy tufts of moss that striveTo drag it to the ground;And this I know, full many a time,When she was on the mountain high,By day, and in the silent night,When all the stars shone clear and bright,That I have heard her cry,‘\ufeffOh misery! oh misery!Oh woe is me! oh misery!’ ”&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Three years she grew in sun and shower, Then Nature said, &amp;quot;A lovelier flower On earth was never sown; This Child I to myself will take; She shall be mine, and I will make A Lady of my own. &amp;quot;Myself will to my darling be Both law and impulse: and with me The Girl, in rock and plain, In earth and heaven, in glade and bower, Shall feel an overseeing power To kindle or restrain. &amp;quot;She shall be sportive as the fawn That wild with glee across the lawn Or up the mountain springs; And hers shall be the breathing balm, And hers the silence and the calm Of mute insensate things. &amp;quot;The floating clouds their state shall lend To her; for her the willow bend; Nor shall she fail to see Even in the motions of the Storm Grace that shall mould the Maiden\&amp;#39;s form By silent sympathy. &amp;quot;The stars of midnight shall be dear To her; and she shall lean her ear In many a secret place Where rivulets dance their wayward round, And beauty born of murmuring sound Shall pass into her face. &amp;quot;And vital feelings of delight Shall rear her form to stately height, Her virgin bosom swell; Such thoughts to Lucy I will give While she and I together live Here in this happy dell.&amp;quot; Thus Nature spake—The work was done— How soon my Lucy\&amp;#39;s race was run! She died, and left to me This heath, this calm and quiet scene; The memory of what has been, And never more will be.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;(At Inversneyde, upon Loch Lomond) Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower Of beauty is thy earthly dower! Twice seven consenting years have shed Their utmost bounty on thy head: And these grey rocks; that household lawn; Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn; This fall of water that doth make A murmur near the silent lake; This little bay; a quiet road That holds in shelter thy Abode— In truth together do ye seem Like something fashioned in a dream; Such Forms as from their covert peep When earthly cares are laid asleep! But, O fair Creature! in the light Of common day, so heavenly bright, I bless Thee, Vision as thou art, I bless thee with a human heart; God shield thee to thy latest years! Thee, neither know I, nor thy peers; And yet my eyes are filled with tears. With earnest feeling I shall pray For thee when I am far away: For never saw I mien, or face, In which more plainly I could trace Benignity and home-bred sense Ripening in perfect innocence. Here scattered, like a random seed, Remote from men, Thou dost not need The embarrassed look of shy distress, And maidenly shamefacedness: Thou wear&amp;#39;st upon thy forehead clear The freedom of a Mountaineer: A face with gladness overspread! Soft smiles, by human kindness bred! And seemliness complete, that sways Thy courtesies, about thee plays; With no restraint, but such as springs From quick and eager visitings Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach Of thy few words of English speech: A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife That gives thy gestures grace and life! So have I, not unmoved in mind, Seen birds of tempest-loving kind— Thus beating up against the wind. What hand but would a garland cull For thee who art so beautiful? O happy pleasure! here to dwell Beside thee in some heathy dell; Adopt your homely ways, and dress, A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess! But I could frame a wish for thee More like a grave reality: Thou art to me but as a wave Of the wild sea; and I would have Some claim upon thee, if I could, Though but of common neighbourhood. What joy to hear thee, and to see! Thy elder Brother I would be, Thy Father—anything to thee! Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace Hath led me to this lonely place. Joy have I had; and going hence I bear away my recompense. In spots like these it is we prize Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes: Then, why should I be loth to stir? I feel this place was made for her; To give new pleasure like the past, Continued long as life shall last. Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart, Sweet Highland Girl! from thee to part; For I, methinks, till I grow old, As fair before me shall behold, As I do now, the cabin small, The lake, the bay, the waterfall; And thee, the spirit of them all!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Ethereal minstrel! pilgrim of the sky! Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound? Or, while the wings aspire, are heart and eye Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground? Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will, Those quivering wings composed, that music still! Leave to the nightingale her shady wood; A privacy of glorious light is thine; Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood Of harmony, with instinct more divine; Type of the wise who soar, but never roam; True to the kindred points of Heaven and Home!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;O blithe New-comer! I have heard, I hear thee and rejoice. O Cuckoo! shall I call thee Bird, Or but a wandering Voice? While I am lying on the grass Thy twofold shout I hear; From hill to hill it seems to pass, At once far off, and near. Though babbling only to the Vale Of sunshine and of flowers, Thou bringest unto me a tale Of visionary hours. Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring! Even yet thou art to me No bird, but an invisible thing, A voice, a mystery; The same whom in my school-boy days I listened to; that Cry Which made me look a thousand ways In bush, and tree, and sky. To seek thee did I often rove Through woods and on the green; And thou wert still a hope, a love; Still longed for, never seen. And I can listen to thee yet; Can lie upon the plain And listen, till I do beget That golden time again. O blessèd Bird! the earth we pace Again appears to be An unsubstantial, faery place; That is fit home for Thee!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrostWith the least shade of thought to sin allied.Woman! above all women glorified,Our tainted nature&amp;#39;s solitary boast;Purer than foam on central ocean tost;Brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewnWith fancied roses, than the unblemished moonBefore her wane begins on heaven&amp;#39;s blue coast;Thy image falls to earth. Yet some, I ween,Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend,As to a visible Power, in which did blendAll that was mixed and reconciled in theeOf mother&amp;#39;s love with maiden purity,Of high with low, celestial with terrene!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;———A simple Child, That lightly draws its breath, And feels its life in every limb, What should it know of death? I met a little cottage Girl: She was eight years old, she said; Her hair was thick with many a curl That clustered round her head. She had a rustic, woodland air, And she was wildly clad: Her eyes were fair, and very fair; —Her beauty made me glad. “Sisters and brothers, little Maid, How many may you be?” “How many? Seven in all,” she said, And wondering looked at me. “And where are they? I pray you tell.” She answered, “Seven are we; And two of us at Conway dwell, And two are gone to sea. “Two of us in the church-yard lie, My sister and my brother; And, in the church-yard cottage, I Dwell near them with my mother.” “You say that two at Conway dwell, And two are gone to sea, Yet ye are seven! I pray you tell, Sweet Maid, how this may be.” Then did the little Maid reply, “Seven boys and girls are we; Two of us in the church-yard lie, Beneath the church-yard tree.” “You run about, my little Maid, Your limbs they are alive; If two are in the church-yard laid, Then ye are only five.” “Their graves are green, they may be seen,” The little Maid replied, “Twelve steps or more from my mother’s door, And they are side by side. “My stockings there I often knit, My kerchief there I hem; And there upon the ground I sit, And sing a song to them. “And often after sun-set, Sir, When it is light and fair, I take my little porringer, And eat my supper there. “The first that died was sister Jane; In bed she moaning lay, Till God released her of her pain; And then she went away. “So in the church-yard she was laid; And, when the grass was dry, Together round her grave we played, My brother John and I. “And when the ground was white with snow, And I could run and slide, My brother John was forced to go, And he lies by her side.” “How many are you, then,” said I, “If they two are in heaven?” Quick was the little Maid’s reply, “O Master! we are seven.” “But they are dead; those two are dead! Their spirits are in heaven!” ’Twas throwing words away; for still The little Maid would have her will, And said, “Nay, we are seven!”&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Why art thou silent! Is thy love a plant Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air Of absence withers what was once so fair? Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant? Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant— Bound to thy service with unceasing care, The mind’s least generous wish a mendicant For nought but what thy happiness could spare. Speak— though this soft warm heart, once free to hold A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine, Be left more desolate, more dreary cold Than a forsaken bird’s-nest filled with snow ‘Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine— Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;The world is too much with us; late and soon, Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;— Little we see in Nature that is ours; We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon! This Sea that bares her bosom to the moon; The winds that will be howling at all hours, And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers; For this, for everything, we are out of tune; It moves us not. Great God! I’d rather be A Pagan suckled in a creed outworn; So might I, standing on this pleasant lea, Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn; Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea; Or hear old Triton blow his wreathèd horn.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;O Friend! I know not which way I must lookFor comfort, being, as I am, opprest,To think that now our life is only drestFor show; mean handy-work of craftsman, cook,Or groom! — We must run glittering like a brookIn the open sunshine, or we are unblest:The wealthiest man among us is the best:No grandeur now in nature or in bookDelights us. Rapine, avarice, expense,This is idolatry; and these we adore:Plain living and high thinking are no more:The homely beauty of the good old causeIs gone; our peace, our fearful innocence,And pure religion breathing household laws.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;The gallant Youth, who may have gained, Or seeks, a &amp;quot;winsome Marrow,&amp;quot; Was but an Infant in the lap When first I looked on Yarrow; Once more, by Newark\&amp;#39;s Castle-gate Long left without a warder, I stood, looked, listened, and with Thee, Great Minstrel of the Border! Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day, Their dignity installing In gentle bosoms, while sere leaves Were on the bough, or falling; But breezes played, and sunshine gleamed- The forest to embolden; Reddened the fiery hues, and shot Transparence through the golden. For busy thoughts the Stream flowed on In foamy agitation; And slept in many a crystal pool For quiet contemplation: No public and no private care The freeborn mind enthralling, We made a day of happy hours, Our happy days recalling. Brisk Youth appeared, the Morn of youth, With freaks of graceful folly,- Life\&amp;#39;s temperate Noon, her sober Eve, Her Night not melancholy; Past, present, future, all appeared In harmony united, Like guests that meet, and some from far, By cordial love invited. And if, as Yarrow, through the woods And down the meadow ranging, Did meet us with unaltered face, Though we were changed and changing; If, then, some natural shadows spread Our inward prospect over, The soul\&amp;#39;s deep valley was not slow Its brightness to recover. Eternal blessings on the Muse, And her divine employment! The blameless Muse, who trains her Sons For hope and calm enjoyment; Albeit sickness, lingering yet, Has o\&amp;#39;er their pillow brooded; And Care waylays their steps-a Sprite Not easily eluded. For thee, O Scott! compelled to change Green Eildon-hill and Cheviot For warm Vesuvio\&amp;#39;s vine-clad slopes; And leave thy Tweed and Tiviot For mild Sorrento\&amp;#39;s breezy waves; May classic Fancy, linking With native Fancy her fresh aid, Preserve thy heart from sinking! Oh! while they minister to thee, Each vying with the other, May Health return to mellow Age With Strength, her venturous brother; And Tiber, and each brook and rill Renowned in song and story, With unimagined beauty shine, Nor lose one ray of glory! For Thou, upon a hundred streams, By tales of love and sorrow, Of faithful love, undaunted truth Hast shed the power of Yarrow; And streams unknown, hills yet unseen, Wherever they invite Thee, At parent Nature\&amp;#39;s grateful call, With gladness must requite Thee. A gracious welcome shall be thine, Such looks of love and honour As thy own Yarrow gave to me When first I gazed upon her; Beheld what I had feared to see, Unwilling to surrender Dreams treasured up from early days, The holy and the tender. And what, for this frail world, were all That mortals do or suffer, Did no responsive harp, no pen, Memorial tribute offer? Yea, what were mighty Nature\&amp;#39;s self? Her features, could they win us, Unhelped by the poetic voice That hourly speaks within us? Nor deem that localized Romance Plays false with our affections; Unsanctifies our tears-made sport For fanciful dejections: Ah, no! the visions of the past Sustain the heart in feeling Life as she is-our changeful Life, With friends and kindred dealing. Bear witness, Ye, whose thoughts that day In Yarrow\&amp;#39;s groves were centred; Who through the silent portal arch Of mouldering Newark entered; And clomb the winding stair that once Too timidly was mounted By the &amp;quot;last Minstrel,&amp;quot;(not the last!) Ere he his Tale recounted. Flow on for ever, Yarrow Stream! Fulfil thy pensive duty, Well pleased that future Bards should chant For simple hearts thy beauty; To dream-light dear while yet unseen, Dear to the common sunshine, And dearer still, as now I feel, To memory\&amp;#39;s shadowy moonshine!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;From Stirling castle we had seenThe mazy Forth unravelled;Had trod the banks of Clyde, and Tay,And with the Tweed had travelled;And when we came to Clovenford,Then said my &amp;quot;winsome Marrow ,&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Whate\&amp;#39;er betide, we\&amp;#39;ll turn aside,And see the Braes of Yarrow.&amp;quot;&amp;quot;Let Yarrow folk, frae Selkirk town,Who have been buying, selling,Go back to Yarrow, \&amp;#39;tis their own;Each maiden to her dwelling!On Yarrow\&amp;#39;s banks let her herons feed,Hares couch, and rabbits burrow!But we will downward with the TweedNor turn aside to Yarrow.&amp;quot;There\&amp;#39;s Galla Water, Leader Haughs,Both lying right before us;And Dryborough, where with chiming TweedThe lintwhites sing in chorus;There\&amp;#39;s pleasant Tiviot-dale, a landMade blithe with plough and harrow:Why throw away a needful dayTo go in search of Yarrow?&amp;quot;What\&amp;#39;s Yarrow but a river bare,That glides the dark hills under?There are a thousand such elsewhereAs worthy of your wonder.&amp;quot;—Strange words they seemed of slight and scorn;My True-love sighed for sorrow;And looked me in the face, to thinkI thus could speak of Yarrow!&amp;quot;Oh! green,&amp;quot; said I, &amp;quot;are Yarrow\&amp;#39;s holms,And sweet is Yarrow flowing!Fair hangs the apple frae the rock,But we will leave it growing.O\&amp;#39;er hilly path, and open Strath,We\&amp;#39;ll wander Scotland thorough;But, though so near, we will not turnInto the dale of Yarrow.&amp;quot;Let beeves and home-bred kine partakeThe sweets of Burn-mill meadow,The swan on still St. Mary\&amp;#39;s LakeFloat double, swan and shadow!We will not see them; will not go,To-day, nor yet to-morrow;Enough if in our hearts we knowThere\&amp;#39;s such a place as Yarrow.&amp;quot;Be Yarrow stream unseen, unknown!It must, or we shall rue it:We have a vision of our own;Ah! why should we undo it?The treasured dreams of times long past,We\&amp;#39;ll keep them, winsome Marrow!For when we\&amp;#39;er there, although \&amp;#39;tis fair,\&amp;#39;Twill be another Yarrow!&amp;quot;If Care with freezing years should come,And wandering seem but folly,—Should we be loth to stir from home,And yet be melancholy;Should life be dull, and spirits low,\&amp;#39;Twill soothe us in our sorrow,That earth has something yet to show,The bonny holms of Yarrow!&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;And is this—Yarrow?—This the stream Of which my fancy cherished, So faithfully, a waking dream? An image that hath perished! O that some Minstrel&amp;#39;s harp were near, To utter notes of gladness, And chase this silence from the air, That fills my heart with sadness! Yet why?—a silvery current flows With uncontrolled meanderings; Nor have these eyes by greener hills Been soothed, in all my wanderings. And, through her depths, Saint Mary&amp;#39;s Lake Is visibly delighted; For not a feature of those hills Is in the mirror slighted. A blue sky bends o&amp;#39;er Yarrow vale, Save where that pearly whiteness Is round the rising sun diffused, A tender hazy brightness; Mild dawn of promise! that excludes All profitless dejection; Though not unwilling here to admit A pensive recollection. Where was it that the famous Flower Of Yarrow Vale lay bleeding? His bed perchance was yon smooth mound On which the herd is feeding: And haply from this crystal pool, Now peaceful as the morning, The Water-wraith ascended thrice— And gave his doleful warning. Delicious is the Lay that sings The haunts of happy Lovers, The path that leads them to the grove, The leafy grove that covers: And Pity sanctifies the Verse That paints, by strength of sorrow, The unconquerable strength of love; Bear witness, rueful Yarrow! But thou, that didst appear so fair To fond imagination, Dost rival in the light of day Her delicate creation: Meek loveliness is round thee spread, A softness still and holy; The grace of forest charms decayed, And pastoral melancholy. That region left, the vale unfolds Rich groves of lofty stature, With Yarrow winding through the pomp Of cultivated nature; And, rising from those lofty groves, Behold a Ruin hoary! The shattered front of Newark&amp;#39;s Towers, Renowned in Border story. Fair scenes for childhood&amp;#39;s opening bloom, For sportive youth to stray in; For manhood to enjoy his strength; And age to wear away in! Yon cottage seems a bower of bliss, A covert for protection Of tender thoughts, that nestle there— The brood of chaste affection. How sweet, on this autumnal day, The wild-wood fruits to gather, And on my True-love&amp;#39;s forehead plant A crest of blooming heather! And what if I enwreathed my own! &amp;#39;Twere no offence to reason; The sober Hills thus deck their brows To meet the wintry season. I see—but not by sight alone, Loved Yarrow, have I won thee; A ray of fancy still survives— Her sunshine plays upon thee! Thy ever-youthful waters keep A course of lively pleasure; And gladsome notes my lips can breathe, Accordant to the measure. The vapours linger round the Heights, They melt, and soon must vanish; One hour is theirs, nor more is mine— Sad thought, which I would banish, But that I know, where&amp;#39;er I go, Thy genuine image, Yarrow! Will dwell with me—to heighten joy, And cheer my mind in sorrow.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;]

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Who is the happy  Warrior?  Who is he That every man in arms should wish to be?— It is the generous  Spirit, who, when brought Among the tasks of real life, hath wrought Upon the plan that pleased his boyish thought: Whose high endeavours are an inward light That makes the path before him always bright; Who, with a natural instinct to discern What knowledge can perform, is diligent to learn; Abides by this resolve, and stops not there, But makes his moral being his prime care; Who, doomed to go in company with  Pain, And  Fear, and  Bloodshed, miserable train! Turns his necessity to glorious gain; In face of these doth exercise a power Which is our human nature&amp;#39;s highest dower: Controls them and subdues, transmutes, bereaves Of their bad influence, and their good receives: By objects, which might force the soul to abate Her feeling, rendered more compassionate; Is placable—because occasions rise So often that demand such sacrifice; More skilful in self-knowledge, even more pure, As tempted more; more able to endure, As more exposed to suffering and distress; Thence, also, more alive to tenderness.—&amp;#39; Tis he whose law is reason; who depends Upon that law as on the best of friends; Whence, in a state where men are tempted still To evil for a guard against worse ill, And what in quality or act is best Doth seldom on a right foundation rest, He labours good on good to fix, and owes To virtue every triumph that he knows:— Who, if he rise to station of command, Rises by open means; and there will stand On honourable terms, or else retire, And in himself possess his own desire; Who comprehends his trust, and to the same Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim; And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state; Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall, Like showers of manna, if they come at all: Whose powers shed round him in the common strife, Or mild concerns of ordinary life, A constant influence, a peculiar grace; But who, if he be called upon to face Some awful moment to which  Heaven has joined Great issues, good or bad for human kind, Is happy as a  Lover; and attired With sudden brightness, like a  Man inspired; And, through the heat of conflict, keeps the law In calmness made, and sees what he foresaw; Or if an unexpected call succeed, Come when it will, is equal to the need:— He who, though thus endued as with a sense And faculty for storm and turbulence, Is yet a  Soul whose master-bias leans To homefelt pleasures and to gentle scenes; Sweet images! which, wheresoe&amp;#39;er he be, Are at his heart; and such fidelity It is his darling passion to approve; More brave for this, that he hath much to love:—&amp;#39; Tis, finally, the  Man, who, lifted high, Conspicuous object in a  Nation&amp;#39;s eye, Or left unthought-of in obscurity,— Who, with a toward or untoward lot, Prosperous or adverse, to his wish or not— Plays, in the many games of life, that one Where what he most doth value must be won: Whom neither shape or danger can dismay, Nor thought of tender happiness betray; Who, not content that former worth stand fast, Looks forward, persevering to the last, From well to better, daily self-surpast: Who, whether praise of him must walk the earth For ever, and to noble deeds give birth, Or he must fall, to sleep without his fame, And leave a dead unprofitable name— Finds comfort in himself and in his cause; And, while the mortal mist is gathering, draws His breath in confidence of  Heaven&amp;#39;s applause: This is the happy  Warrior; this is he That every man in arms should wish to be.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; There is a change—and  I am poor;  Your love hath been, nor long ago,  A fountain at my fond heart&amp;#39;s door,  Whose only business was to flow;  And flow it did; not taking heed  Of its own bounty, or my need.  What happy moments did  I count!  Blest was  I then all bliss above!  Now, for that consecrated fount  Of murmuring, sparkling, living love,  What have  I? shall  I dare to tell?  A comfortless and hidden well.  A well of love—it may be deep—  I trust it is,—and never dry:  What matter? if the waters sleep  In silence and obscurity. — Such change, and at the very door  Of my fond heart, hath made me poor.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Earth has not any thing to show more fair:  Dull would he be of soul who could pass by  A sight so touching in its majesty:  This  City now doth, like a garment, wear  The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,  Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie  Open unto the fields, and to the sky;  All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.  Never did sun more beautifully steep  In his first splendour, valley, rock, or hill;  Ne&amp;#39;er saw  I, never felt, a calm so deep!  The river glideth at his own sweet will:  Dear  God! the very houses seem asleep;  And all that mighty heart is lying still!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged  Pile!  Four summer weeks  I dwelt in sight of thee:  I saw thee every day; and all the while  Thy  Form was sleeping on a glassy sea.  So pure the sky, so quiet was the air!  So like, so very like, was day to day!  Whene&amp;#39;er  I looked, thy  Image still was there;  It trembled, but it never passed away.  How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep;  No mood, which season takes away, or brings:  I could have fancied that the mighty  Deep  Was even the gentlest of all gentle things.  Ah! then , if mine had been the  Painter&amp;#39;s hand,  To express what then  I saw; and add the gleam,  The light that never was, on sea or land,  The consecration, and the  Poet&amp;#39;s dream;  I would have planted thee, thou hoary  Pile  Amid a world how different from this!  Beside a sea that could not cease to smile;  On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss.  Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine  Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;—  Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine  The very sweetest had to thee been given.  A  Picture had it been of lasting ease,  Elysian quiet, without toil or strife;  No motion but the moving tide, a breeze,  Or merely silent  Nature&amp;#39;s breathing life.  Such, in the fond illusion of my heart,  Such  Picture would  I at that time have made:  And seen the soul of truth in every part,  A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed.  So once it would have been,—&amp;#39;tis so no more;  I have submitted to a new control:  A power is gone, which nothing can restore;  A deep distress hath humanised my  Soul.  Not for a moment could  I now behold  A smiling sea, and be what  I have been:  The feeling of my loss will ne&amp;#39;er be old;  This, which  I know,  I speak with mind serene.  Then,  Beaumont,  Friend! who would have been the  Friend,  If he had lived, of  Him whom  I deplore,  This work of thine  I blame not, but commend;  This sea in anger, and that dismal shore.  O &amp;#39;tis a passionate  Work!—yet wise and well,  Well chosen is the spirit that is here;  That  Hulk which labours in the deadly swell,  This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear!  And this huge  Castle, standing here sublime,  I love to see the look with which it braves,  Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time,  The lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves.  Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone,  Housed in a dream, at distance from the  Kind!  Such happiness, wherever it be known,  Is to be pitied; for &amp;#39;tis surely blind.  But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer,  And frequent sights of what is to be borne!  Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.—  Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; When first, descending from the moorlands,  I saw the  Stream of  Yarrow glide  Along a bare and open valley,  The  Ettrick  Shepherd was my guide.  When last along its banks  I wandered,  Through groves that had begun to shed  Their golden leaves upon the pathways,  My steps the  Border-minstrel led.  The mighty  Minstrel breathes no longer, \&amp;#39; Mid mouldering ruins low he lies;  And death upon the braes of  Yarrow,  Has closed the  Shepherd-poet\&amp;#39;s eyes:  Nor has the rolling year twice measured,  From sign to sign, its stedfast course,  Since every mortal power of  Coleridge  Was frozen at its marvellous source;  The rapt  One, of the godlike forehead,  The heaven-eyed creature sleeps in earth:  And  Lamb, the frolic and the gentle,  Has vanished from his lonely hearth.  Like clouds that rake the mountain-summits,  Or waves that own no curbing hand,  How fast has brother followed brother,  From sunshine to the sunless land!  Yet  I, whose lids from infant slumber  Were earlier raised, remain to hear  A timid voice, that asks in whispers, &amp;quot; Who next will drop and disappear?&amp;quot;  Our haughty life is crowned with darkness,  Like  London with its own black wreath,  On which with thee,  O  Crabbe! forth-looking,  I gazed from  Hampstead\&amp;#39;s breezy heath.  As if but yesterday departed,  Thou too art gone before; but why,  O\&amp;#39;er ripe fruit, seasonably gathered,  Should frail survivors heave a sigh?  Mourn rather for that holy  Spirit,  Sweet as the spring, as ocean deep;  For  Her who, ere her summer faded,  Has sunk into a breathless sleep.  No more of old romantic sorrows,  For slaughtered  Youth or love-lorn  Maid!  With sharper grief is  Yarrow smitten,  And  Ettrick mourns with her their  Poet dead.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Oh! pleasant exercise of hope and joy!  For mighty were the auxiliars which then stood  Upon our side, we who were strong in love!  Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,  But to be young was very heaven!— Oh! times,  In which the meagre, stale, forbidding ways  Of custom, law, and statute, took at once  The attraction of a country in romance!  When  Reason seemed the most to assert her rights,  When most intent on making of herself  A prime  Enchantress—to assist the work  Which then was going forward in her name!  Not favoured spots alone, but the whole earth,  The beauty wore of promise, that which sets ( As at some moment might not be unfelt  Among the bowers of paradise itself )  The budding rose above the rose full blown.  What temper at the prospect did not wake  To happiness unthought of?  The inert  Were roused, and lively natures rapt away!  They who had fed their childhood upon dreams,  The playfellows of fancy, who had made  All powers of swiftness, subtilty, and strength  Their ministers,—who in lordly wise had stirred  Among the grandest objects of the sense,  And dealt with whatsoever they found there  As if they had within some lurking right  To wield it;—they, too, who, of gentle mood,  Had watched all gentle motions, and to these  Had fitted their own thoughts, schemers more wild,  And in the region of their peaceful selves;—  Now was it that both found, the meek and lofty  Did both find, helpers to their heart&amp;#39;s desire,  And stuff at hand, plastic as they could wish;  Were called upon to exercise their skill,  Not in  Utopia, subterranean fields,  Or some secreted island,  Heaven knows where!  But in the very world, which is the world  Of all of us,—the place where in the end  We find our happiness, or not at all!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Beneath these fruit-tree boughs that shed  Their snow-white blossoms on my head,  With brightest sunshine round me spread  Of spring&amp;#39;s unclouded weather,  In this sequestered nook how sweet  To sit upon my orchard-seat!  And birds and flowers once more to greet,  My last year&amp;#39;s friends together.  One have  I marked, the happiest guest  In all this covert of the blest:  Hail to  Thee, far above the rest  In joy of voice and pinion!  Thou,  Linnet! in thy green array,  Presiding  Spirit here to-day,  Dost lead the revels of the  May;  And this is thy dominion.  While birds, and butterflies, and flowers,  Make all one band of paramours,  Thou, ranging up and down the bowers,  Art sole in thy employment:  A  Life, a  Presence like the  Air,  Scattering thy gladness without care,  Too blest with any one to pair;  Thyself thy own enjoyment.  Amid yon tuft of hazel trees,  That twinkle to the gusty breeze,  Behold him perched in ecstasies,  Yet seeming still to hover;  There! where the flutter of his wings  Upon his back and body flings  Shadows and sunny glimmerings,  That cover him all over.  My dazzled sight he oft deceives,  A brother of the dancing leaves;  Then flits, and from the cottage-eaves  Pours forth his song in gushes;  As if by that exulting strain  He mocked and treated with disdain  The voiceless  Form he chose to feign,  While fluttering in the bushes.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; I travelled among unknown men,  In lands beyond the sea;  Nor,  England! did  I know till then  What love  I bore to thee. &amp;#39; Tis past, that melancholy dream!  Nor will  I quit thy shore  A second time; for still  I seem  To love thee more and more.  Among thy mountains did  I feel  The joy of my desire;  And she  I cherished turned her wheel  Beside an  English fire.  Thy mornings showed, thy nights concealed,  The bowers where  Lucy played;  And thine too is the last green field  That  Lucy&amp;#39;s eyes surveyed.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; I wandered lonely as a cloud  That floats on high o&amp;#39;er vales and hills,  When all at once  I saw a crowd,  A host, of golden daffodils;  Beside the lake, beneath the trees,  Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.  Continuous as the stars that shine  And twinkle on the milky way,  They stretched in never-ending line  Along the margin of a bay:  Ten thousand saw  I at a glance,  Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.  The waves beside them danced; but they  Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:  A poet could not but be gay,  In such a jocund company:  I gazed—and gazed—but little thought  What wealth the show to me had brought:  For oft, when on my couch  I lie  In vacant or in pensive mood,  They flash upon that inward eye  Which is the bliss of solitude;  And then my heart with pleasure fills,  And dances with the daffodils.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Wisdom and  Spirit of the universe!  Thou  Soul, that art the  Eternity of thought!  And giv&amp;#39;st to forms and images a breath  And everlasting motion! not in vain,  By day or star-light, thus from my first dawn  Of childhood didst thou intertwine for me  The passions that build up our human soul;  Not with the mean and vulgar works of  Man;  But with high objects, with enduring things,  With life and nature; purifying thus  The elements of feeling and of thought,  And sanctifying by such discipline  Both pain and fear,—until we recognise  A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.  Nor was this fellowship vouchsafed to me  With stinted kindness.  In  November days,  When vapours rolling down the valleys made  A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods  At noon; and &amp;#39;mid the calm of summer nights,  When, by the margin of the trembling lake,  Beneath the gloomy hills, homeward  I went  In solitude, such intercourse was mine:  Mine was it in the fields both day and night,  And by the waters, all the summer long.  And in the frosty season, when the sun  Was set, and, visible for many a mile,  The cottage-windows through the twilight blazed,  I heeded not the summons: happy time  It was indeed for all of us; for me  It was a time of rapture!  Clear and loud  The village-clock tolled six— I wheeled about,  Proud and exulting like an untired horse  That cares not for his home.— All shod with steel  We hissed along the polished ice, in games  Confederate, imitative of the chase  And woodland pleasures,—the resounding horn,  The pack loud-chiming, and the hunted hare.  So through the darkness and the cold we flew,  And not a voice was idle; with the din  Smitten, the precipices rang aloud;  The leafless trees and every icy crag  Tinkled like iron; while far-distant hills  Into the tumult sent an alien sound  Of melancholy, not unnoticed while the stars,  Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west  The orange sky of evening died away.  Not seldom from the uproar  I retired  Into a silent bay, or sportively  Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,  To cut across the reflex of a star;  Image, that, flying still before me, gleamed  Upon the glassy plain: and oftentimes,  When we had given our bodies to the wind,  And all the shadowy banks on either side  Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still  The rapid line of motion, then at once  Have  I, reclining back upon my heels,  Stopped short; yet still the solitary cliffs  Wheeled by me—even as if the earth had rolled  With visible motion her diurnal round!  Behind me did they stretch in solemn train,  Feebler and feebler, and  I stood and watched  Till all was tranquil as a summer sea.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; Tax not the royal  Saint with vain expense, With ill-matched aims the  Architect who planned— Albeit labouring for a scanty band Of white-robed  Scholars only—this immense And glorious  Work of fine intelligence! Give all thou canst; high  Heaven rejects the lore Of nicely-calculated less or more; So deemed the man who fashioned for the sense These lofty pillars, spread that branching roof Self-poised, and scooped into ten thousand cells, Where light and shade repose, where music dwells Lingering—and wandering on as loth to die; Like thoughts whose very sweetness yieldeth proof That they were born for immortality.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,  The holy time is quiet as a  Nun  Breathless with adoration; the broad sun  Is sinking down in its tranquility;  The gentleness of heaven broods o&amp;#39;er the  Sea;  Listen! the mighty  Being is awake,  And doth with his eternal motion make  A sound like thunder—everlastingly.  Dear child! dear  Girl! that walkest with me here,  If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,  Thy nature is not therefore less divine:  Thou liest in  Abraham&amp;#39;s bosom all the year;  And worshipp&amp;#39;st at the  Temple&amp;#39;s inner shrine,  God being with thee when we know it not.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; It is not to be thought of that the  Flood Of  British freedom, which, to the open sea Of the world\&amp;#39;s praise, from dark antiquity Hath flowed, &amp;quot;with pomp of waters, unwithstood,&amp;quot; Roused though it be full often to a mood Which spurns the check of salutary bands, That this most famous  Stream in bogs and sands Should perish; and to evil and to good Be lost for ever.  In our halls is hung Armoury of the invincible  Knights of old: We must be free or die, who speak the tongue That  Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold Which  Milton held.— In every thing we are sprung Of  Earth\&amp;#39;s first blood, have titles manifold.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;quot; With sacrifice before the rising morn  Vows have  I made by fruitless hope inspired;  And from the infernal  Gods, \&amp;#39;mid shades forlorn  Of night, my slaughtered  Lord have  I required:  Celestial pity  I again implore;—  Restore him to my sight—great  Jove, restore!&amp;quot;  So speaking, and by fervent love endowed  With faith, the  Suppliant heavenward lifts her hands;  While, like the sun emerging from a cloud,  Her countenance brightens—and her eye expands;  Her bosom heaves and spreads, her stature grows;  As she expects the issue in repose.  O terror! what hath she perceived?— O joy!  What doth she look on?—whom doth she behold?  Her  Hero slain upon the beach of  Troy?  His vital presence? his corporeal mould?  It is—if sense deceive her not—\&amp;#39;tis  He!  And a  God leads him, wingèd  Mercury!  Mild  Hermes spake—and touched her with his wand  That calms all fear; &amp;quot; Such grace hath crowned thy prayer,  Laodamía! that at  Jove\&amp;#39;s command  Thy husband walks the paths of upper air:  He comes to tarry with thee three hours\&amp;#39; space;  Accept the gift, behold him face to face!&amp;quot;  Forth sprang the impassioned  Queen her  Lord to clasp;  Again that consummation she essayed;  But unsubstantial  Form eludes her grasp  As often as that eager grasp was made.  The  Phantom parts—but parts to re-unite,  And re-assume his place before her sight. &amp;quot; Protesiláus, lo! thy guide is gone!  Confirm,  I pray, the vision with thy voice:  This is our palace,—yonder is thy throne;  Speak, and the floor thou tread\&amp;#39;st on will rejoice.  Not to appal me have the gods bestowed  This precious boon; and blest a sad abode.&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Great  Jove,  Laodamía! doth not leave  His gifts imperfect:— Spectre though  I be,  I am not sent to scare thee or deceive;  But in reward of thy fidelity.  And something also did my worth obtain;  For fearless virtue bringeth boundless gain. &amp;quot; Thou knowest, the  Delphic oracle foretold  That the first  Greek who touched the  Trojan strand  Should die; but me the threat could not withhold:  A generous cause a victim did demand;  And forth  I leapt upon the sandy plain;  A self-devoted chief—by  Hector slain.&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Supreme of  Heroes—bravest, noblest, best!  Thy matchless courage  I bewail no more,  Which then, when tens of thousands were deprest  By doubt, propelled thee to the fatal shore;  Thou found\&amp;#39;st—and  I forgive thee—here thou art—  A nobler counsellor than my poor heart. &amp;quot; But thou, though capable of sternest deed,  Wert kind as resolute, and good as brave;  And he, whose power restores thee, hath decreed  Thou should\&amp;#39;st elude the malice of the grave:  Redundant are thy locks, thy lips as fair  As when their breath enriched  Thessalian air. &amp;quot; No spectre greets me,—no vain  Shadow this;  Come, blooming  Hero, place thee by my side!  Give, on this well-known couch, one nuptial kiss  To me, this day a second time thy bride!&amp;quot;  Jove frowned in heaven: the conscious  Parcæ threw  Upon those roseate lips a  Stygian hue. &amp;quot; This visage tells thee that my doom is past:  Nor should the change be mourned, even if the joys  Of sense were able to return as fast  And surely as they vanish.  Earth destroys  Those raptures duly—- Erebus disdains:  Calm pleasures there abide—majestic pains. &amp;quot; Be taught,  O faithful  Consort, to control  Rebellious passion: for the  Gods approve  The depth, and not the tumult, of the soul;  A fervent, not ungovernable love.  Thy transports moderate; and meekly mourn  When  I depart, for brief is my sojourn—&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Ah wherefore?— Did not  Hercules by force  Wrest from the guardian monster of the tomb  Alcestis, a reanimated corse,  Given back to dwell on earth in vernal bloom?  Medea\&amp;#39;s spells dispersed the weight of years,  And Æson stood a youth \&amp;#39;mid youthful peers. &amp;quot; The  Gods to us are merciful—and they  Yet further may relent: for mightier far  Than strength of nerve and sinew, or the sway  Of magic potent over sun and star,  Is love, though oft to agony distrest,  And though his favourite seat be feeble woman\&amp;#39;s breast. &amp;quot; But if thou goest,  I follow—&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Peace!&amp;quot; he said,—  She looked upon him and was calmed and cheered;  The ghastly colour from his lips had fled;  In his deportment, shape, and mien, appeared  Elysian beauty, melancholy grace,  Brought from a pensive though a happy place.  He spake of love, such love as  Spirits feel  In worlds whose course is equable and pure;  No fears to beat away—no strife to heal—  The past unsighed for, and the future sure;  Spake of heroic arts in graver mood  Revived, with finer harmony pursued;  Of all that is most beauteous—imaged there  In happier beauty; more pellucid streams,  An ampler ether, a diviner air,  And fields invested with purpureal gleams;  Climes which the sun, who sheds the brightest day  Earth knows, is all unworthy to survey.  Yet there the  Soul shall enter which hath earned  That privilege by virtue.—&amp;quot; Ill,&amp;quot; said he, &amp;quot; The end of man\&amp;#39;s existence  I discerned,  Who from ignoble games and revelry  Could draw, when we had parted, vain delight,  While tears were thy best pastime, day and night; &amp;quot; And while my youthful peers before my eyes ( Each hero following his peculiar bent)  Prepared themselves for glorious enterprise  By martial sports,—or, seated in the tent,  Chieftains and kings in council were detained;  What time the fleet at  Aulis lay enchained. &amp;quot; The wished-for wind was given:— I then revolved  The oracle, upon the silent sea;  And, if no worthier led the way, resolved  That, of a thousand vessels, mine should be  The foremost prow in pressing to the strand,—  Mine the first blood that tinged the  Trojan sand. &amp;quot; Yet bitter, oft-times bitter, was the pang  When of thy loss  I thought, belovèd  Wife!  On thee too fondly did my memory hang,  And on the joys we shared in mortal life,—  The paths which we had trod—these fountains, flowers:  My new-planned cities, and unfinished towers. &amp;quot; But should suspense permit the  Foe to cry, \&amp;#39; Behold they tremble!—haughty their array,  Yet of their numbers no one dares to die?\&amp;#39;  In soul  I swept the indignity away:  Old frailties then recurred:—but lofty thought,  In act embodied, my deliverance wrought. &amp;quot; And  Thou, though strong in love, art all too weak  In reason, in self-government too slow;  I counsel thee by fortitude to seek  Our blest re-union in the shades below.  The invisible world with thee hath sympathised;  Be thy affections raised and solemnised. &amp;quot; Learn, by a mortal yearning, to ascend—  Seeking a higher object.  Love was given,  Encouraged, sanctioned, chiefly for that end;  For this the passion to excess was driven—  That self might be annulled: her bondage prove  The fetters of a dream opposed to love.—  Aloud she shrieked! for  Hermes re-appears!  Round the dear  Shade she would have clung—\&amp;#39;tis vain:  The hours are past—too brief had they been years;  And him no mortal effort can detain:  Swift, toward the realms that know not earthly day,  He through the portal takes his silent way,  And on the palace-floor a lifeless corse  She lay.  Thus, all in vain exhorted and reproved,  She perished; and, as for a wilful crime,  By the just  Gods whom no weak pity moved,  Was doomed to wear out her appointed time,  Apart from happy  Ghosts, that gather flowers  Of blissful quiet \&amp;#39;mid unfading bowers. — Yet tears to human suffering are due;  And mortal hopes defeated and o\&amp;#39;erthrown  Are mourned by man, and not by man alone,  As fondly he believes.— Upon the side  Of  Hellespont (such faith was entertained)  A knot of spiry trees for ages grew  From out the tomb of him for whom she died;  And ever, when such stature they had gained  That  Ilium\&amp;#39;s walls were subject to their view,  The trees\&amp;#39; tall summits withered at the sight;  A constant interchange of growth and blight!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Five years have past; five summers, with the length  Of five long winters! and again  I hear  These waters, rolling from their mountain-springs  With a soft inland murmur.— Once again  Do  I behold these steep and lofty cliffs,  That on a wild secluded scene impress  Thoughts of more deep seclusion; and connect  The landscape with the quiet of the sky.  The day is come when  I again repose  Here, under this dark sycamore, and view  These plots of cottage-ground, these orchard-tufts,  Which at this season, with their unripe fruits,  Are clad in one green hue, and lose themselves &amp;#39; Mid groves and copses.  Once again  I see  These hedge-rows, hardly hedge-rows, little lines  Of sportive wood run wild: these pastoral farms,  Green to the very door; and wreaths of smoke  Sent up, in silence, from among the trees!  With some uncertain notice, as might seem  Of vagrant dwellers in the houseless woods,  Or of some  Hermit&amp;#39;s cave, where by his fire  The  Hermit sits alone.  These beauteous forms,  Through a long absence, have not been to me  As is a landscape to a blind man&amp;#39;s eye:  But oft, in lonely rooms, and &amp;#39;mid the din  Of towns and cities,  I have owed to them,  In hours of weariness, sensations sweet,  Felt in the blood, and felt along the heart;  And passing even into my purer mind  With tranquil restoration:—feelings too  Of unremembered pleasure: such, perhaps,  As have no slight or trivial influence  On that best portion of a good man&amp;#39;s life,  His little, nameless, unremembered, acts  Of kindness and of love.  Nor less,  I trust,  To them  I may have owed another gift,  Of aspect more sublime; that blessed mood,  In which the burthen of the mystery,  In which the heavy and the weary weight  Of all this unintelligible world,  Is lightened:—that serene and blessed mood,  In which the affections gently lead us on,—  Until, the breath of this corporeal frame  And even the motion of our human blood  Almost suspended, we are laid asleep  In body, and become a living soul:  While with an eye made quiet by the power  Of harmony, and the deep power of joy,  We see into the life of things.  If this  Be but a vain belief, yet, oh! how oft—  In darkness and amid the many shapes  Of joyless daylight; when the fretful stir  Unprofitable, and the fever of the world,  Have hung upon the beatings of my heart—  How oft, in spirit, have  I turned to thee,  O sylvan  Wye! thou wanderer thro&amp;#39; the woods,  How often has my spirit turned to thee!  And now, with gleams of half-extinguished thought,  With many recognitions dim and faint,  And somewhat of a sad perplexity,  The picture of the mind revives again:  While here  I stand, not only with the sense  Of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts  That in this moment there is life and food  For future years.  And so  I dare to hope,  Though changed, no doubt, from what  I was when first  I came among these hills; when like a roe  I bounded o&amp;#39;er the mountains, by the sides  Of the deep rivers, and the lonely streams,  Wherever nature led: more like a man  Flying from something that he dreads, than one  Who sought the thing he loved.  For nature then ( The coarser pleasures of my boyish days  And their glad animal movements all gone by)  To me was all in all.— I cannot paint  What then  I was.  The sounding cataract  Haunted me like a passion: the tall rock,  The mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood,  Their colours and their forms, were then to me  An appetite; a feeling and a love,  That had no need of a remoter charm,  By thought supplied, not any interest  Unborrowed from the eye.— That time is past,  And all its aching joys are now no more,  And all its dizzy raptures.  Not for this  Faint  I, nor mourn nor murmur; other gifts  Have followed; for such loss,  I would believe,  Abundant recompense.  For  I have learned  To look on nature, not as in the hour  Of thoughtless youth; but hearing oftentimes  The still sad music of humanity,  Nor harsh nor grating, though of ample power  To chasten and subdue.— And  I have felt  A presence that disturbs me with the joy  Of elevated thoughts; a sense sublime  Of something far more deeply interfused,  Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns,  And the round ocean and the living air,  And the blue sky, and in the mind of man:  A motion and a spirit, that impels  All thinking things, all objects of all thought,  And rolls through all things.  Therefore am  I still  A lover of the meadows and the woods  And mountains; and of all that we behold  From this green earth; of all the mighty world  Of eye, and ear,—both what they half create,  And what perceive; well pleased to recognise  In nature and the language of the sense  The anchor of my purest thoughts, the nurse,  The guide, the guardian of my heart, and soul  Of all my moral being.  Nor perchance,  If  I were not thus taught, should  I the more  Suffer my genial spirits to decay:  For thou art with me here upon the banks  Of this fair river; thou my dearest  Friend,  My dear, dear  Friend; and in thy voice  I catch  The language of my former heart, and read  My former pleasures in the shooting lights  Of thy wild eyes.  Oh! yet a little while  May  I behold in thee what  I was once,  My dear, dear  Sister! and this prayer  I make,  Knowing that  Nature never did betray  The heart that loved her; &amp;#39;tis her privilege,  Through all the years of this our life, to lead  From joy to joy: for she can so inform  The mind that is within us, so impress  With quietness and beauty, and so feed  With lofty thoughts, that neither evil tongues,  Rash judgments, nor the sneers of selfish men,  Nor greetings where no kindness is, nor all  The dreary intercourse of daily life,  Shall e&amp;#39;er prevail against us, or disturb  Our cheerful faith, that all which we behold  Is full of blessings.  Therefore let the moon  Shine on thee in thy solitary walk;  And let the misty mountain-winds be free  To blow against thee: and, in after years,  When these wild ecstasies shall be matured  Into a sober pleasure; when thy mind  Shall be a mansion for all lovely forms,  Thy memory be as a dwelling-place  For all sweet sounds and harmonies; oh! then,  If solitude, or fear, or pain, or grief,  Should be thy portion, with what healing thoughts  Of tender joy wilt thou remember me,  And these my exhortations!  Nor, perchance—  If  I should be where  I no more can hear  Thy voice, nor catch from thy wild eyes these gleams  Of past existence—wilt thou then forget  That on the banks of this delightful stream  We stood together; and that  I, so long  A worshipper of  Nature, hither came  Unwearied in that service: rather say  With warmer love—oh! with far deeper zeal  Of holier love.  Nor wilt thou then forget,  That after many wanderings, many years  Of absence, these steep woods and lofty cliffs,  And this green pastoral landscape, were to me  More dear, both for themselves and for thy sake!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; I heard a thousand blended notes,  While in a grove  I sate reclined,  In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts  Bring sad thoughts to the mind.  To her fair works did  Nature link  The human soul that through me ran;  And much it grieved my heart to think  What man has made of man.  Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,  The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;  And ’tis my faith that every flower  Enjoys the air it breathes.  The birds around me hopped and played,  Their thoughts  I cannot measure:—  But the least motion which they made  It seemed a thrill of pleasure.  The budding twigs spread out their fan,  To catch the breezy air;  And  I must think, do all  I can,  That there was pleasure there.  If this belief from heaven be sent,  If such be  Nature’s holy plan,  Have  I not reason to lament  What man has made of man?&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Milton! thou shouldst be living at this hour: England hath need of thee: she is a fen Of stagnant waters: altar, sword, and pen, Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower, Have forfeited their ancient  English dower Of inward happiness.  We are selfish men; Oh! raise us up, return to us again; And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power. Thy soul was like a  Star, and dwelt apart: Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea: Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free, So didst thou travel on life&amp;#39;s common way, In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart The lowliest duties on herself did lay.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes To pace the ground, if path be there or none, While a fair region round the traveller lies Which he forbears again to look upon; Pleased rather with some soft ideal scene, The work of  Fancy, or some happy tone Of meditation, slipping in between The beauty coming and the beauty gone. If  Thought and  Love desert us, from that day Let us break off all commerce with the  Muse: With  Thought and  Love companions of our way, Whate&amp;#39;er the senses take or may refuse, The  Mind&amp;#39;s internal heaven shall shed her dews Of inspiration on the humblest lay.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; From low to high doth dissolution climb,  And sink from high to low, along a scale  Of awful notes, whose concord shall not fail;  A musical but melancholy chime,  Which they can hear who meddle not with crime,  Nor avarice, nor over-anxious care.  Truth fails not; but her outward forms that bear  The longest date do melt like frosty rime,  That in the morning whitened hill and plain  And is no more; drop like the tower sublime  Of yesterday, which royally did wear  His crown of weeds, but could not even sustain  Some casual shout that broke the silent air,  Or the unimaginable touch of  Time.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Another year!—another deadly blow! Another mighty  Empire overthrown! And  We are left, or shall be left, alone; The last that dare to struggle with the  Foe.&amp;#39; Tis well! from this day forward we shall know That in ourselves our safety must be sought; That by our own right hands it must be wrought; That we must stand unpropped, or be laid low. O dastard whom such foretaste doth not cheer! We shall exult, if they who rule the land Be men who hold its many blessings dear, Wise, upright, valiant; not a servile band, Who are to judge of danger which they fear, And honour which they do not understand.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; Nuns fret not at their convent’s narrow room;  And hermits are contented with their cells;  And students with their pensive citadels;  Maids at the wheel, the weaver at his loom,  Sit blithe and happy; bees that soar for bloom,  High as the highest  Peak of  Furness-fells,  Will murmur by the hour in foxglove bells:  In truth the prison, into which we doom  Ourselves, no prison is: and hence for me,  In sundry moods, ’twas pastime to be bound  Within the  Sonnet’s scanty plot of ground;  Pleased if some  Souls (for such there needs must be)  Who have felt the weight of too much liberty,  Should find brief solace there, as  I have found.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;— It seems a day( I speak of one from many singled out) One of those heavenly days that cannot die; When, in the eagerness of boyish hope, I left our cottage-threshold, sallying forth With a huge wallet o&amp;#39;er my shoulders slung, A nutting-crook in hand; and turned my steps Tow&amp;#39;rd some far-distant wood, a  Figure quaint, Tricked out in proud disguise of cast-off weeds Which for that service had been husbanded, By exhortation of my frugal  Dame— Motley accoutrement, of power to smile At thorns, and brakes, and brambles,—and, in truth, More ragged than need was!  O&amp;#39;er pathless rocks, Through beds of matted fern, and tangled thickets, Forcing my way,  I came to one dear nook Unvisited, where not a broken bough Drooped with its withered leaves, ungracious sign Of devastation; but the hazels rose Tall and erect, with tempting clusters hung, A virgin scene!— A little while  I stood, Breathing with such suppression of the heart As joy delights in; and, with wise restraint Voluptuous, fearless of a rival, eyed The banquet;—or beneath the trees  I sate Among the flowers, and with the flowers  I played; A temper known to those, who, after long And weary expectation, have been blest With sudden happiness beyond all hope. Perhaps it was a bower beneath whose leaves The violets of five seasons re-appear And fade, unseen by any human eye; Where fairy water-breaks do murmur on For ever; and  I saw the sparkling foam, And—with my cheek on one of those green stones That, fleeced with moss, under the shady trees, Lay round me, scattered like a flock of sheep— I heard the murmur, and the murmuring sound, In that sweet mood when pleasure loves to pay Tribute to ease; and, of its joy secure, The heart luxuriates with indifferent things, Wasting its kindliness on stocks and stones, And on the vacant air.  Then up  I rose, And dragged to earth both branch and bough, with crash And merciless ravage: and the shady nook Of hazels, and the green and mossy bower, Deformed and sullied, patiently gave up Their quiet being: and, unless  I now Confound my present feelings with the past; Ere from the mutilated bower  I turned Exulting, rich beyond the wealth of kings, I felt a sense of pain when  I beheld The silent trees, and saw the intruding sky.— Then, dearest  Maiden, move along these shades In gentleness of heart; with gentle hand Touch—for there is a spirit in the woods.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; These times strike monied worldlings with dismay: Even rich men, brave by nature, taint the air With words of apprehension and despair: While tens of thousands, thinking on the affray, Men unto whom sufficient for the day And minds not stinted or untilled are given, Sound, healthy, children of the  God of heaven, Are cheerful as the rising sun in  May. What do we gather hence but firmer faith That every gift of noble origin Is breathed upon by  Hope&amp;#39;s perpetual breath; That virtue and the faculties within Are vital,—and that riches are akin To fear, to change, to cowardice, and death?&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; The child is father of the man;  And  I could wish my days to be  Bound each to each by natural piety. ( Wordsworth, &amp;quot; My  Heart  Leaps  Up&amp;quot;)  There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream,  The earth, and every common sight,  To me did seem  Apparelled in celestial light,  The glory and the freshness of a dream.  It is not now as it hath been of yore;—  Turn wheresoe\&amp;#39;er  I may,  By night or day.  The things which  I have seen  I now can see no more.  The  Rainbow comes and goes,  And lovely is the  Rose,  The  Moon doth with delight  Look round her when the heavens are bare,  Waters on a starry night  Are beautiful and fair;  The sunshine is a glorious birth;  But yet  I know, where\&amp;#39;er  I go,  That there hath past away a glory from the earth.  Now, while the birds thus sing a joyous song,  And while the young lambs bound  As to the tabor\&amp;#39;s sound,  To me alone there came a thought of grief:  A timely utterance gave that thought relief,  And  I again am strong:  The cataracts blow their trumpets from the steep;  No more shall grief of mine the season wrong;  I hear the  Echoes through the mountains throng,  The  Winds come to me from the fields of sleep,  And all the earth is gay;  Land and sea  Give themselves up to jollity,  And with the heart of  May  Doth every  Beast keep holiday;—  Thou  Child of  Joy,  Shout round me, let me hear thy shouts, thou happy  Shepherd-boy.  Ye blessèd creatures,  I have heard the call  Ye to each other make;  I see  The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee;  My heart is at your festival,  My head hath its coronal,  The fulness of your bliss,  I feel— I feel it all.  Oh evil day! if  I were sullen  While  Earth herself is adorning,  This sweet  May-morning,  And the  Children are culling  On every side,  In a thousand valleys far and wide,  Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm,  And the  Babe leaps up on his  Mother\&amp;#39;s arm:—  I hear,  I hear, with joy  I hear! — But there\&amp;#39;s a  Tree, of many, one,  A single field which  I have looked upon,  Both of them speak of something that is gone;  The  Pansy at my feet  Doth the same tale repeat:  Whither is fled the visionary gleam?  Where is it now, the glory and the dream?  Our birth is but a sleep and a forgetting:  The  Soul that rises with us, our life\&amp;#39;s  Star,  Hath had elsewhere its setting,  And cometh from afar:  Not in entire forgetfulness,  And not in utter nakedness,  But trailing clouds of glory do we come  From  God, who is our home:  Heaven lies about us in our infancy!  Shades of the prison-house begin to close  Upon the growing  Boy,  But he beholds the light, and whence it flows,  He sees it in his joy;  The  Youth, who daily farther from the east  Must travel, still is  Nature\&amp;#39;s  Priest,  And by the vision splendid  Is on his way attended;  At length the  Man perceives it die away,  And fade into the light of common day.  Earth fills her lap with pleasures of her own;  Yearnings she hath in her own natural kind,  And, even with something of a  Mother\&amp;#39;s mind,  And no unworthy aim,  The homely  Nurse doth all she can  To make her  Foster-child, her  Inmate  Man,  Forget the glories he hath known,  And that imperial palace whence he came.  Behold the  Child among his new-born blisses,  A six years\&amp;#39;  Darling of a pigmy size!  See, where \&amp;#39;mid work of his own hand he lies,  Fretted by sallies of his mother\&amp;#39;s kisses,  With light upon him from his father\&amp;#39;s eyes!  See, at his feet, some little plan or chart,  Some fragment from his dream of human life,  Shaped by himself with newly-learn{e}d art  A wedding or a festival,  A mourning or a funeral;  And this hath now his heart,  And unto this he frames his song:  Then will he fit his tongue  To dialogues of business, love, or strife;  But it will not be long  Ere this be thrown aside,  And with new joy and pride  The little  Actor cons another part;  Filling from time to time his &amp;quot;humorous stage&amp;quot;  With all the  Persons, down to palsied  Age,  That  Life brings with her in her equipage;  As if his whole vocation  Were endless imitation.  Thou, whose exterior semblance doth belie  Thy  Soul\&amp;#39;s immensity;  Thou best  Philosopher, who yet dost keep  Thy heritage, thou  Eye among the blind,  That, deaf and silent, read\&amp;#39;st the eternal deep,  Haunted for ever by the eternal mind,—  Mighty  Prophet!  Seer blest!  On whom those truths do rest,  Which we are toiling all our lives to find,  In darkness lost, the darkness of the grave;  Thou, over whom thy  Immortality  Broods like the  Day, a  Master o\&amp;#39;er a  Slave,  A  Presence which is not to be put by;  Thou little  Child, yet glorious in the might  Of heaven-born freedom on thy being\&amp;#39;s height,  Why with such earnest pains dost thou provoke  The years to bring the inevitable yoke,  Thus blindly with thy blessedness at strife?  Full soon thy  Soul shall have her earthly freight,  And custom lie upon thee with a weight,  Heavy as frost, and deep almost as life!  O joy! that in our embers  Is something that doth live,  That  Nature yet remembers  What was so fugitive!  The thought of our past years in me doth breed  Perpetual benediction: not indeed  For that which is most worthy to be blest;  Delight and liberty, the simple creed  Of  Childhood, whether busy or at rest,  With new-fledged hope still fluttering in his breast:—  Not for these  I raise  The song of thanks and praise  But for those obstinate questionings  Of sense and outward things,  Fallings from us, vanishings;  Blank misgivings of a  Creature  Moving about in worlds not realised,  High instincts before which our mortal  Nature  Did tremble like a guilty thing surprised:  But for those first affections,  Those shadowy recollections,  Which, be they what they may  Are yet the fountain-light of all our day,  Are yet a master-light of all our seeing;  Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make  Our noisy years seem moments in the being  Of the eternal  Silence: truths that wake,  To perish never;  Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour,  Nor  Man nor  Boy,  Nor all that is at enmity with joy,  Can utterly abolish or destroy!  Hence in a season of calm weather  Though inland far we be,  Our  Souls have sight of that immortal sea  Which brought us hither,  Can in a moment travel thither,  And see the  Children sport upon the shore,  And hear the mighty waters rolling evermore.  Then sing, ye  Birds, sing, sing a joyous song!  And let the young  Lambs bound  As to the tabor\&amp;#39;s sound!  We in thought will join your throng,  Ye that pipe and ye that play,  Ye that through your hearts to-day  Feel the gladness of the  May!  What though the radiance which was once so bright  Be now for ever taken from my sight,  Though nothing can bring back the hour  Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower;  We will grieve not, rather find  Strength in what remains behind;  In the primal sympathy  Which having been must ever be;  In the soothing thoughts that spring  Out of human suffering;  In the faith that looks through death,  In years that bring the philosophic mind.  And  O, ye  Fountains,  Meadows,  Hills, and  Groves,  Forebode not any severing of our loves!  Yet in my heart of hearts  I feel your might;  I only have relinquished one delight  To live beneath your more habitual sway.  I love the  Brooks which down their channels fret,  Even more than when  I tripped lightly as they;  The innocent brightness of a new-born  Day  Is lovely yet;  The  Clouds that gather round the setting sun  Do take a sober colouring from an eye  That hath kept watch o\&amp;#39;er man\&amp;#39;s mortality;  Another race hath been, and other palms are won.  Thanks to the human heart by which we live,  Thanks to its tenderness, its joys, and fears,  To me the meanest flower that blows can give  Thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; Jam non consilio bonus, sed more eo perductus, ut non tantum recte facere possim, sed nisi recte facere non possim&amp;quot; &amp;quot; I am no longer good through deliberate intent, but by long habit have reached a point where  I am not only able to do right, but am unable to do anything but what is right.&amp;quot; ( Seneca,  Letters 120.10)  Stern  Daughter of the  Voice of  God!  O  Duty! if that name thou love  Who art a light to guide, a rod  To check the erring, and reprove;  Thou, who art victory and law  When empty terrors overawe;  From vain temptations dost set free;  And calm\&amp;#39;st the weary strife of frail humanity!  There are who ask not if thine eye  Be on them; who, in love and truth,  Where no misgiving is, rely  Upon the genial sense of youth:  Glad  Hearts! without reproach or blot;  Who do thy work, and know it not:  Oh! if through confidence misplaced  They fail, thy saving arms, dread  Power! around them cast.  Serene will be our days and bright,  And happy will our nature be,  When love is an unerring light,  And joy its own security.  And they a blissful course may hold  Even now, who, not unwisely bold,  Live in the spirit of this creed;  Yet seek thy firm support, according to their need.  I, loving freedom, and untried;  No sport of every random gust,  Yet being to myself a guide,  Too blindly have reposed my trust:  And oft, when in my heart was heard  Thy timely mandate,  I deferred  The task, in smoother walks to stray;  But thee  I now would serve more strictly, if  I may.  Through no disturbance of my soul,  Or strong compunction in me wrought,  I supplicate for thy control;  But in the quietness of thought:  Me this unchartered freedom tires;  I feel the weight of chance-desires:  My hopes no more must change their name,  I long for a repose that ever is the same.  Stern  Lawgiver! yet thou dost wear  The  Godhead\&amp;#39;s most benignant grace;  Nor know we anything so fair  As is the smile upon thy face:  Flowers laugh before thee on their beds  And fragrance in thy footing treads;  Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong;  And the most ancient heavens, through  Thee, are fresh and strong.  To humbler functions, awful  Power!  I call thee:  I myself commend  Unto thy guidance from this hour;  Oh, let my weakness have an end!  Give unto me, made lowly wise,  The spirit of self-sacrifice;  The confidence of reason give;  And in the light of truth thy  Bondman let me live!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; A trouble, not of clouds, or weeping rain, Nor of the setting sun&amp;#39;s pathetic light Engendered, hangs o&amp;#39;er  Eildon&amp;#39;s triple height: Spirits of  Power, assembled there, complain For kindred  Power departing from their sight; While  Tweed, best pleased in chanting a blithe strain, Saddens his voice again, and yet again. Lift up your hearts, ye  Mourners! for the might Of the whole world&amp;#39;s good wishes with him goes; Blessings and prayers in nobler retinue Than sceptred king or laurelled conqueror knows, Follow this wondrous  Potentate.  Be true, Ye winds of ocean, and the midland sea, Wafting your  Charge to soft  Parthenope!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; Once did  She hold the gorgeous east in fee; And was the safeguard of the west: the worth Of  Venice did not fall below her birth, Venice, the eldest  Child of  Liberty. She was a maiden  City, bright and free; No guile seduced, no force could violate; And, when she took unto herself a  Mate, She must espouse the everlasting  Sea. And what if she had seen those glories fade, Those titles vanish, and that strength decay; Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid When her long life hath reached its final day: Men are we, and must grieve when even the  Shade Of that which once was great is passed away.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; A poet!— He hath put his heart to school, Nor dares to move unpropped upon the staff Which art hath lodged within his hand—must laugh By precept only, and shed tears by rule. Thy  Art be  Nature; the live current quaff, And let the groveller sip his stagnant pool, In fear that else, when  Critics grave and cool Have killed him,  Scorn should write his epitaph. How does the  Meadow-flower its bloom unfold? Because the lovely little flower is free Down to its root, and, in that freedom, bold; And so the grandeur of the  Forest-tree Comes not by casting in a formal mould, But from its own divine vitality.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; The power of  Armies is a visible thing, Formal and circumscribed in time and space; But who the limits of that power shall trace Which a brave  People into light can bring Or hide, at will,—for freedom combating By just revenge inflamed?  No foot may chase, No eye can follow, to a fatal place That power, that spirit, whether on the wing Like the strong wind, or sleeping like the wind Within its awful caves.— From year to year Springs this indigenous produce far and near; No craft this subtle element can bind, Rising like water from the soil, to find In every nook a lip that it may cheer.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;— Was it for this  That one, the fairest of all  Rivers, lov&amp;#39;d  To blend his murmurs with my  Nurse&amp;#39;s song,  And from his alder shades and rocky falls,  And from his fords and shallows, sent a voice  That flow&amp;#39;d along my dreams?  For this, didst  Thou,  O  Derwent! travelling over the green  Plains  Near my &amp;#39;sweet  Birthplace&amp;#39;, didst thou, beauteous  Stream  Make ceaseless music through the night and day  Which with its steady cadence, tempering  Our human waywardness, compos&amp;#39;d my thoughts  To more than infant softness, giving me,  Among the fretful dwellings of mankind,  A knowledge, a dim earnest, of the calm  That  Nature breathes among the hills and groves.  When, having left his  Mountains, to the  Towers  Of  Cockermouth that beauteous  River came,  Behind my  Father&amp;#39;s  House he pass&amp;#39;d, close by,  Along the margin of our  Terrace  Walk.  He was a  Playmate whom we dearly lov&amp;#39;d.  Oh! many a time have  I, a five years&amp;#39;  Child,  A naked  Boy, in one delightful  Rill,  A little  Mill-race sever&amp;#39;d from his stream,  Made one long bathing of a summer&amp;#39;s day,  Bask&amp;#39;d in the sun, and plunged, and bask&amp;#39;d again  Alternate all a summer&amp;#39;s day, or cours&amp;#39;d  Over the sandy fields, leaping through groves  Of yellow grunsel, or when crag and hill,  The woods, and distant  Skiddaw&amp;#39;s lofty height,  Were bronz&amp;#39;d with a deep radiance, stood alone  Beneath the sky, as if  I had been born  On  Indian  Plains, and from my  Mother&amp;#39;s hut  Had run abroad in wantonness, to sport,  A naked  Savage, in the thunder shower.  Fair seed-time had my soul, and  I grew up  Foster&amp;#39;d alike by beauty and by fear;  Much favour&amp;#39;d in my birthplace, and no less  In that beloved  Vale to which, erelong,  I was transplanted.  Well  I call to mind (&amp;#39; Twas at an early age, ere  I had seen  Nine summers) when upon the mountain slope  The frost and breath of frosty wind had snapp&amp;#39;d  The last autumnal crocus, &amp;#39;twas my joy  To wander half the night among the  Cliffs  And the smooth  Hollows, where the woodcocks ran  Along the open turf.  In thought and wish  That time, my shoulder all with springes hung,  I was a fell destroyer.  On the heights  Scudding away from snare to snare,  I plied  My anxious visitation, hurrying on,  Still hurrying, hurrying onward; moon and stars  Were shining o&amp;#39;er my head;  I was alone,  And seem&amp;#39;d to be a trouble to the peace  That was among them.  Sometimes it befel  In these night-wanderings, that a strong desire  O&amp;#39;erpower&amp;#39;d my better reason, and the bird  Which was the captive of another&amp;#39;s toils  Became my prey; and, when the deed was done  I heard among the solitary hills  Low breathings coming after me, and sounds  Of undistinguishable motion, steps  Almost as silent as the turf they trod.  Nor less in springtime when on southern banks  The shining sun had from his knot of leaves  Decoy&amp;#39;d the primrose flower, and when the  Vales  And woods were warm, was  I a plunderer then  In the high places, on the lonesome peaks  Where&amp;#39;er, among the mountains and the winds,  The  Mother  Bird had built her lodge.  Though mean  My object, and inglorious, yet the end  Was not ignoble.  Oh! when  I have hung  Above the raven&amp;#39;s nest, by knots of grass  And half-inch fissures in the slippery rock  But ill sustain&amp;#39;d, and almost, as it seem&amp;#39;d,  Suspended by the blast which blew amain,  Shouldering the naked crag;  Oh! at that time,  While on the perilous ridge  I hung alone,  With what strange utterance did the loud dry wind  Blow through my ears! the sky seem&amp;#39;d not a sky  Of earth, and with what motion mov&amp;#39;d the clouds!  The mind of  Man is fram&amp;#39;d even like the breath  And harmony of music.  There is a dark  Invisible workmanship that reconciles  Discordant elements, and makes them move  In one society.  Ah me! that all  The terrors, all the early miseries  Regrets, vexations, lassitudes, that all  The thoughts and feelings which have been infus&amp;#39;d  Into my mind, should ever have made up  The calm existence that is mine when  I  Am worthy of myself!  Praise to the end!  Thanks likewise for the means!  But  I believe  That  Nature, oftentimes, when she would frame  A favor&amp;#39;d  Being, from his earliest dawn  Of infancy doth open out the clouds,  As at the touch of lightning, seeking him  With gentlest visitation; not the less,  Though haply aiming at the self-same end,  Does it delight her sometimes to employ  Severer interventions, ministry  More palpable, and so she dealt with me.  One evening (surely  I was led by her)  I went alone into a  Shepherd&amp;#39;s  Boat,  A  Skiff that to a  Willow tree was tied  Within a rocky  Cave, its usual home. &amp;#39; Twas by the shores of  Patterdale, a  Vale  Wherein  I was a  Stranger, thither come  A  School-boy  Traveller, at the  Holidays.  Forth rambled from the  Village  Inn alone  No sooner had  I sight of this small  Skiff,  Discover&amp;#39;d thus by unexpected chance,  Than  I unloos&amp;#39;d her tether and embark&amp;#39;d.  The moon was up, the  Lake was shining clear  Among the hoary mountains; from the  Shore  I push&amp;#39;d, and struck the oars and struck again  In cadence, and my little  Boat mov&amp;#39;d on  Even like a  Man who walks with stately step  Though bent on speed.  It was an act of stealth  And troubled pleasure; not without the voice  Of mountain-echoes did my  Boat move on,  Leaving behind her still on either side  Small circles glittering idly in the moon,  Until they melted all into one track  Of sparkling light.  A rocky  Steep uprose  Above the  Cavern of the  Willow tree  And now, as suited one who proudly row&amp;#39;d  With his best skill,  I fix&amp;#39;d a steady view  Upon the top of that same craggy ridge,  The bound of the horizon, for behind  Was nothing but the stars and the grey sky.  She was an elfin  Pinnace; lustily  I dipp&amp;#39;d my oars into the silent  Lake,  And, as  I rose upon the stroke, my  Boat  Went heaving through the water, like a  Swan;  When from behind that craggy  Steep, till then  The bound of the horizon, a huge  Cliff,  As if with voluntary power instinct,  Uprear&amp;#39;d its head.  I struck, and struck again  And, growing still in stature, the huge  Cliff  Rose up between me and the stars, and still,  With measur&amp;#39;d motion, like a living thing,  Strode after me.  With trembling hands  I turn&amp;#39;d,  And through the silent water stole my way  Back to the  Cavern of the  Willow tree.  There, in her mooring-place,  I left my  Bark,  And, through the meadows homeward went, with grave  And serious thoughts; and after  I had seen  That spectacle, for many days, my brain  Work&amp;#39;d with a dim and undetermin&amp;#39;d sense  Of unknown modes of being; in my thoughts  There was a darkness, call it solitude,  Or blank desertion, no familiar shapes  Of hourly objects, images of trees,  Of sea or sky, no colours of green fields;  But huge and mighty  Forms that do not live  Like living men mov&amp;#39;d slowly through the mind  By day and were the trouble of my dreams.  Wisdom and  Spirit of the universe!  Thou  Soul that art the eternity of thought!  That giv&amp;#39;st to forms and images a breath  And everlasting motion! not in vain,  By day or star-light thus from my first dawn  Of  Childhood didst  Thou intertwine for me  The passions that build up our human  Soul,  Not with the mean and vulgar works of  Man,  But with high objects, with enduring things,  With life and nature, purifying thus  The elements of feeling and of thought,  And sanctifying, by such discipline,  Both pain and fear, until we recognize  A grandeur in the beatings of the heart.  Nor was this fellowship vouchsaf&amp;#39;d to me  With stinted kindness.  In  November days,  When vapours, rolling down the valleys, made  A lonely scene more lonesome; among woods  At noon, and &amp;#39;mid the calm of summer nights,  When, by the margin of the trembling  Lake,  Beneath the gloomy hills  I homeward went  In solitude, such intercourse was mine; &amp;#39; Twas mine among the fields both day and night,  And by the waters all the summer long.  And in the frosty season, when the sun  Was set, and visible for many a mile  The cottage windows through the twilight blaz&amp;#39;d,  I heeded not the summons:—happy time  It was, indeed, for all of us; to me  It was a time of rapture: clear and loud  The village clock toll&amp;#39;d six;  I wheel&amp;#39;d about,  Proud and exulting, like an untired horse,  That cares not for its home.— All shod with steel,  We hiss&amp;#39;d along the polish&amp;#39;d ice, in games  Confederate, imitative of the chace  And woodland pleasures, the resounding horn,  The  Pack loud bellowing, and the hunted hare.  So through the darkness and the cold we flew,  And not a voice was idle; with the din,  Meanwhile, the precipices rang aloud,  The leafless trees, and every icy crag  Tinkled like iron, while the distant hills  Into the tumult sent an alien sound  Of melancholy, not unnoticed, while the stars,  Eastward, were sparkling clear, and in the west  The orange sky of evening died away.  Not seldom from the uproar  I retired  Into a silent bay, or sportively  Glanced sideway, leaving the tumultuous throng,  To cut across the image of a star  That gleam&amp;#39;d upon the ice: and oftentimes  When we had given our bodies to the wind,  And all the shadowy banks, on either side,  Came sweeping through the darkness, spinning still  The rapid line of motion; then at once  Have  I, reclining back upon my heels,  Stopp&amp;#39;d short, yet still the solitary  Cliffs  Wheeled by me, even as if the earth had roll&amp;#39;d  With visible motion her diurnal round;  Behind me did they stretch in solemn train  Feebler and feebler, and  I stood and watch&amp;#39;d  Till all was tranquil as a dreamless sleep.  Ye  Presences of  Nature, in the sky  And on the earth!  Ye  Visions of the hills!  And  Souls of lonely places! can  I think  A vulgar hope was yours when  Ye employ&amp;#39;d  Such ministry, when  Ye through many a year  Haunting me thus among my boyish sports,  On caves and trees, upon the woods and hills,  Impress&amp;#39;d upon all forms the characters  Of danger or desire, and thus did make  The surface of the universal earth  With triumph, and delight, and hope, and fear,  Work like a sea?  Not uselessly employ&amp;#39;d,  I might pursue this theme through every change  Of exercise and play, to which the year  Did summon us in its delightful round.  We were a noisy crew, the sun in heaven  Beheld not vales more beautiful than ours,  Nor saw a race in happiness and joy  More worthy of the ground where they were sown.  I would record with no reluctant voice  The woods of autumn and their hazel bowers  With milk-white clusters hung; the rod and line,  True symbol of the foolishness of hope,  Which with its strong enchantment led us on  By rocks and pools, shut out from every star  All the green summer, to forlorn cascades  Among the windings of the mountain brooks. — Unfading recollections! at this hour  The heart is almost mine with which  I felt  From some hill-top, on sunny afternoons  The  Kite high up among the fleecy clouds  Pull at its rein, like an impatient  Courser,  Or, from the meadows sent on gusty days,  Beheld her breast the wind, then suddenly  Dash&amp;#39;d headlong; and rejected by the storm.  Ye lowly  Cottages in which we dwelt,  A ministration of your own was yours,  A sanctity, a safeguard, and a love!  Can  I forget you, being as ye were  So beautiful among the pleasant fields  In which ye stood?  Or can  I here forget  The plain and seemly countenance with which  Ye dealt out your plain comforts?  Yet had ye  Delights and exultations of your own.  Eager and never weary we pursued  Our home amusements by the warm peat-fire  At evening; when with pencil and with slate,  In square divisions parcell&amp;#39;d out, and all  With crosses and with cyphers scribbled o&amp;#39;er,  We schemed and puzzled, head opposed to head  In strife too humble to be named in  Verse.  Or round the naked table, snow-white deal,  Cherry or maple, sate in close array,  And to the combat,  Lu or  Whist, led on thick-ribbed  Army; not as in the world  Neglected and ungratefully thrown by  Even for the very service they had wrought,  But husbanded through many a long campaign.  Uncouth assemblage was it, where no few  Had changed their functions, some, plebeian cards,  Which  Fate beyond the promise of their birth  Had glorified, and call&amp;#39;d to represent  The persons of departed  Potentates.  Oh! with what echoes on the  Board they fell!  Ironic  Diamonds,  Clubs,  Hearts,  Diamonds,  Spades,  A congregation piteously akin.  Cheap matter did they give to boyish wit,  Those sooty knaves, precipitated down  With scoffs and taunts, like  Vulcan out of  Heaven,  The paramount  Ace, a moon in her eclipse,  Queens, gleaming through their splendour&amp;#39;s last decay,  And  Monarchs, surly at the wrongs sustain&amp;#39;d  By royal visages.  Meanwhile, abroad  The heavy rain was falling, or the frost  Raged bitterly, with keen and silent tooth,  And, interrupting oft the impassion&amp;#39;d game,  From  Esthwaite&amp;#39;s neighbouring  Lake the splitting ice,  While it sank down towards the water, sent,  Among the meadows and the hills, its long  And dismal yellings, like the noise of wolves  When they are howling round the  Bothnic  Main.  Nor, sedulous as  I have been to trace  How  Nature by extrinsic passion first  Peopled my mind with beauteous forms or grand,  And made me love them, may  I well forget  How other pleasures have been mine, and joys  Of subtler origin; how  I have felt,  Not seldom, even in that tempestuous time,  Those hallow&amp;#39;d and pure motions of the sense  Which seem, in their simplicity, to own  An intellectual charm, that calm delight  Which, if  I err not, surely must belong  To those first-born affinities that fit  Our new existence to existing things,  And, in our dawn of being, constitute  The bond of union betwixt life and joy.  Yes,  I remember, when the changeful earth,  And twice five seasons on my mind had stamp&amp;#39;d  The faces of the moving year, even then,  A  Child,  I held unconscious intercourse  With the eternal  Beauty, drinking in  A pure organic pleasure from the lines  Of curling mist, or from the level plain  Of waters colour&amp;#39;d by the steady clouds.  The  Sands of  Westmoreland, the  Creeks and  Bays  Of  Cumbria&amp;#39;s rocky limits, they can tell  How when the  Sea threw off his evening shade  And to the  Shepherd&amp;#39;s huts beneath the crags  Did send sweet notice of the rising moon,  How  I have stood, to fancies such as these,  Engrafted in the tenderness of thought,  A stranger, linking with the spectacle  No conscious memory of a kindred sight,  And bringing with me no peculiar sense  Of quietness or peace, yet  I have stood,  Even while mine eye has mov&amp;#39;d o&amp;#39;er three long leagues  Of shining water, gathering, as it seem&amp;#39;d,  Through every hair-breadth of that field of light,  New pleasure, like a bee among the flowers.  Thus, often in those fits of vulgar joy  Which, through all seasons, on a child&amp;#39;s pursuits  Are prompt attendants, &amp;#39;mid that giddy bliss  Which, like a tempest, works along the blood  And is forgotten; even then  I felt  Gleams like the flashing of a shield; the earth  And common face of  Nature spake to me  Rememberable things; sometimes, &amp;#39;tis true,  By chance collisions and quaint accidents  Like those ill-sorted unions, work suppos&amp;#39;d  Of evil-minded fairies, yet not vain  Nor profitless, if haply they impress&amp;#39;d  Collateral objects and appearances,  Albeit lifeless then, and doom&amp;#39;d to sleep  Until maturer seasons call&amp;#39;d them forth  To impregnate and to elevate the mind. — And if the vulgar joy by its own weight  Wearied itself out of the memory,  The scenes which were a witness of that joy  Remained, in their substantial lineaments  Depicted on the brain, and to the eye  Were visible, a daily sight; and thus  By the impressive discipline of fear,  By pleasure and repeated happiness,  So frequently repeated, and by force  Of obscure feelings representative  Of joys that were forgotten, these same scenes,  So beauteous and majestic in themselves,  Though yet the day was distant, did at length  Become habitually dear, and all  Their hues and forms were by invisible links  Allied to the affections.  I began  My story early, feeling as  I fear,  The weakness of a human love, for days  Disown&amp;#39;d by memory, ere the birth of spring  Planting my snowdrops among winter snows.  Nor will it seem to thee, my  Friend! so prompt  In sympathy, that  I have lengthen&amp;#39;d out,  With fond and feeble tongue, a tedious tale.  Meanwhile, my hope has been that  I might fetch  Invigorating thoughts from former years,  Might fix the wavering balance of my mind,  And haply meet reproaches, too, whose power  May spur me on, in manhood now mature,  To honorable toil.  Yet should these hopes  Be vain, and thus should neither  I be taught  To understand myself, nor thou to know  With better knowledge how the heart was fram&amp;#39;d  Of him thou lovest, need  I dread from thee  Harsh judgments, if  I am so loth to quit  Those recollected hours that have the charm  Of visionary things, and lovely forms  And sweet sensations that throw back our life  And almost make our  Infancy itself  A visible scene, on which the sun is shining?  One end hereby at least hath been attain&amp;#39;d,  My mind hath been revived, and if this mood  Desert me not,  I will forthwith bring down,  Through later years, the story of my life.  The road lies plain before me; &amp;#39;tis a theme  Single and of determined bounds; and hence  I chuse it rather at this time, than work  Of ampler or more varied argument.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Thus far,  O  Friend! have we, though leaving much  Unvisited, endeavour&amp;#39;d to retrace  My life through its first years, and measured back  The way  I travell&amp;#39;d when  I first began  To love the woods and fields; the passion yet  Was in its birth, sustain&amp;#39;d, as might befal,  By nourishment that came unsought, for still,  From week to week, from month to month, we liv&amp;#39;d  A round of tumult: duly were our games  Prolong&amp;#39;d in summer till the day-light fail&amp;#39;d;  No chair remain&amp;#39;d before the doors, the bench  And threshold steps were empty; fast asleep  The  Labourer, and the old  Man who had sate,  A later lingerer, yet the revelry  Continued, and the loud uproar: at last,  When all the ground was dark, and the huge clouds  Were edged with twinkling stars, to bed we went,  With weary joints, and with a beating mind.  Ah! is there one who ever has been young,  Nor needs a monitory voice to tame  The pride of virtue, and of intellect?  And is there one, the wisest and the best  Of all mankind, who does not sometimes wish  For things which cannot be, who would not give,  If so he might, to duty and to truth  The eagerness of infantine desire?  A tranquillizing spirit presses now  On my corporeal frame: so wide appears  The vacancy between me and those days,  Which yet have such self-presence in my mind  That, sometimes, when  I think of them,  I seem  Two consciousnesses, conscious of myself  And of some other  Being.  A grey  Stone  Of native rock, left midway in the  Square  Of our small market  Village, was the home  And centre of these joys, and when, return&amp;#39;d  After long absence, thither  I repair&amp;#39;d,  I found that it was split, and gone to build  A smart  Assembly-room that perk&amp;#39;d and flar&amp;#39;d  With wash and rough-cast elbowing the ground  Which had been ours.  But let the fiddle scream,  And be ye happy! yet, my  Friends!  I know  That more than one of you will think with me  Of those soft starry nights, and that old  Dame  From whom the stone was nam&amp;#39;d who there had sate  And watch&amp;#39;d her  Table with its huckster&amp;#39;s wares  Assiduous, thro&amp;#39; the length of sixty years.  We ran a boisterous race; the year span round  With giddy motion.  But the time approach&amp;#39;d  That brought with it a regular desire  For calmer pleasures, when the beauteous forms  Of  Nature were collaterally attach&amp;#39;d  To every scheme of holiday delight,  And every boyish sport, less grateful else,  And languidly pursued.  When summer came  It was the pastime of our afternoons  To beat along the plain of  Windermere  With rival oars, and the selected bourne  Was now an  Island musical with birds  That sang for ever; now a  Sister  Isle  Beneath the oaks&amp;#39; umbrageous covert, sown  With lillies of the valley, like a field;  And now a third small  Island where remain&amp;#39;d  An old stone  Table, and a moulder&amp;#39;d  Cave,  A  Hermit&amp;#39;s history.  In such a race,  So ended, disappointment could be none,  Uneasiness, or pain, or jealousy:  We rested in the shade, all pleas&amp;#39;d alike,  Conquer&amp;#39;d and  Conqueror.  Thus the pride of strength,  And the vain-glory of superior skill  Were interfus&amp;#39;d with objects which subdu&amp;#39;d  And temper&amp;#39;d them, and gradually produc&amp;#39;d  A quiet independence of the heart.  And to my  Friend, who knows me,  I may add,  Unapprehensive of reproof, that hence  Ensu&amp;#39;d a diffidence and modesty,  And  I was taught to feel, perhaps too much,  The self-sufficing power of solitude.  No delicate viands sapp&amp;#39;d our bodily strength;  More than we wish&amp;#39;d we knew the blessing then  Of vigorous hunger, for our daily meals  Were frugal,  Sabine fare! and then, exclude  A little weekly stipend, and we lived  Through three divisions of the quarter&amp;#39;d year  In pennyless poverty.  But now, to  School  Return&amp;#39;d, from the half-yearly holidays,  We came with purses more profusely fill&amp;#39;d,  Allowance which abundantly suffic&amp;#39;d  To gratify the palate with repasts  More costly than the  Dame of whom  I spake,  That ancient  Woman, and her board supplied.  Hence inroads into distant  Vales, and long  Excursions far away among the hills,  Hence rustic dinners on the cool green ground,  Or in the woods, or near a river side,  Or by some shady fountain, while soft airs  Among the leaves were stirring, and the sun  Unfelt, shone sweetly round us in our joy.  Nor is my aim neglected, if  I tell  How twice in the long length of those half-years  We from our funds, perhaps, with bolder hand  Drew largely, anxious for one day, at least,  To feel the motion of the galloping  Steed;  And with the good old  Inn-keeper, in truth,  On such occasion sometimes we employ&amp;#39;d  Sly subterfuge; for the intended bound  Of the day&amp;#39;s journey was too distant far  For any cautious man, a  Structure famed  Beyond its neighbourhood, the antique  Walls  Of that large  Abbey which within the vale  Of  Nightshade, to  St.  Mary&amp;#39;s honour built,  Stands yet, a mouldering  Pile, with fractured  Arch,  Belfry, and  Images, and living  Trees,  A holy  Scene! along the smooth green turf  Our  Horses grazed: to more than inland peace  Left by the sea wind passing overhead ( Though wind of roughest temper) trees and towers  May in that  Valley oftentimes be seen,  Both silent and both motionless alike;  Such is the shelter that is there, and such  The safeguard for repose and quietness.  Our steeds remounted, and the summons given,  With whip and spur we by the  Chauntry flew  In uncouth race, and left the cross-legg&amp;#39;d  Knight,  And the stone- Abbot, and that single  Wren  Which one day sang so sweetly in the  Nave  Of the old  Church, that, though from recent showers  The earth was comfortless, and, touch&amp;#39;d by faint  Internal breezes, sobbings of the place,  And respirations, from the roofless walls  The shuddering ivy dripp&amp;#39;d large drops, yet still,  So sweetly &amp;#39;mid the gloom the invisible  Bird  Sang to itself, that there  I could have made  My dwelling-place, and liv&amp;#39;d for ever there  To hear such music.  Through the  Walls we flew  And down the valley, and a circuit made  In wantonness of heart, through rough and smooth  We scamper&amp;#39;d homeward.  Oh! ye  Rocks and  Streams,  And that still  Spirit of the evening air!  Even in this joyous time  I sometimes felt  Your presence, when with slacken&amp;#39;d step we breath&amp;#39;d  Along the sides of the steep hills, or when,  Lighted by gleams of moonlight from the sea,  We beat with thundering hoofs the level sand.  Upon the  Eastern  Shore of  Windermere,  Above the crescent of a pleasant  Bay,  There stood an  Inn, no homely-featured  Shed,  Brother of the surrounding  Cottages,  But &amp;#39;twas a splendid place, the door beset  With  Chaises,  Grooms, and  Liveries, and within  Decanters,  Glasses, and the blood-red  Wine.  In ancient times, or ere the  Hall was built  On the large  Island, had this  Dwelling been  More worthy of a  Poet&amp;#39;s love, a  Hut,  Proud of its one bright fire, and sycamore shade.  But though the rhymes were gone which once inscribed  The threshold, and large golden characters  On the blue-frosted  Signboard had usurp&amp;#39;d  The place of the old  Lion, in contempt  And mockery of the rustic painter&amp;#39;s hand,  Yet to this hour the spot to me is dear  With all its foolish pomp.  The garden lay  Upon a slope surmounted by the plain  Of a small  Bowling-green; beneath us stood  A grove; with gleams of water through the trees  And over the tree-tops; nor did we want  Refreshment, strawberries and mellow cream.  And there, through half an afternoon, we play&amp;#39;d  On the smooth platform, and the shouts we sent  Made all the mountains ring.  But ere the fall  Of night, when in our pinnace we return&amp;#39;d  Over the dusky  Lake, and to the beach  Of some small  Island steer&amp;#39;d our course with one,  The  Minstrel of our troop, and left him there,  And row&amp;#39;d off gently, while he blew his flute  Alone upon the rock;  Oh! then the calm  And dead still water lay upon my mind  Even with a weight of pleasure, and the sky  Never before so beautiful, sank down  Into my heart, and held me like a dream.  Thus daily were my sympathies enlarged,  And thus the common range of visible things  Grew dear to me: already  I began  To love the sun, a  Boy  I lov&amp;#39;d the sun,  Not as  I since have lov&amp;#39;d him, as a pledge  And surety of our earthly life, a light  Which while we view we feel we are alive;  But, for this cause, that  I had seen him lay  His beauty on the morning hills, had seen  The western mountain touch his setting orb,  In many a thoughtless hour, when, from excess  Of happiness, my blood appear&amp;#39;d to flow  With its own pleasure, and  I breath&amp;#39;d with joy.  And from like feelings, humble though intense,  To patriotic and domestic love  Analogous, the moon to me was dear;  For  I would dream away my purposes,  Standing to look upon her while she hung  Midway between the hills, as if she knew  No other region; but belong&amp;#39;d to thee,  Yea, appertain&amp;#39;d by a peculiar right  To thee and thy grey huts, my darling  Vale!  Those incidental charms which first attach&amp;#39;d  My heart to rural objects, day by day  Grew weaker, and  I hasten on to tell  How  Nature, intervenient till this time,  And secondary, now at length was sought  For her own sake.  But who shall parcel out  His intellect, by geometric rules,  Split, like a province, into round and square?  Who knows the individual hour in which  His habits were first sown, even as a seed,  Who that shall point, as with a wand, and say, &amp;#39; This portion of the river of my mind  Came from yon fountain?&amp;#39;  Thou, my  Friend! art one  More deeply read in thy own thoughts; to thee  Science appears but, what in truth she is,  Not as our glory and our absolute boast,  But as a succedaneum, and a prop  To our infirmity.  Thou art no slave  Of that false secondary power, by which,  In weakness, we create distinctions, then  Deem that our puny boundaries are things  Which we perceive, and not which we have made.  To thee, unblinded by these outward shows,  The unity of all has been reveal&amp;#39;d  And thou wilt doubt with me, less aptly skill&amp;#39;d  Than many are to class the cabinet  Of their sensations, and, in voluble phrase,  Run through the history and birth of each,  As of a single independent thing.  Hard task to analyse a soul, in which,  Not only general habits and desires,  But each most obvious and particular thought,  Not in a mystical and idle sense,  But in the words of reason deeply weigh&amp;#39;d,  Hath no beginning.  Bless&amp;#39;d the infant  Babe, ( For with my best conjectures  I would trace  The progress of our  Being) blest the  Babe,  Nurs&amp;#39;d in his  Mother&amp;#39;s arms, the  Babe who sleeps  Upon his  Mother&amp;#39;s breast, who, when his soul  Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul,  Doth gather passion from his  Mother&amp;#39;s eye!  Such feelings pass into his torpid life  Like an awakening breeze, and hence his mind  Even [in the first trial of its powers]  Is prompt and watchful, eager to combine  In one appearance, all the elements  And parts of the same object, else detach&amp;#39;d  And loth to coalesce.  Thus, day by day,  Subjected to the discipline of love,  His organs and recipient faculties  Are quicken&amp;#39;d, are more vigorous, his mind spreads,  Tenacious of the forms which it receives.  In one beloved presence, nay and more,  In that most apprehensive habitude  And those sensations which have been deriv&amp;#39;d  From this beloved  Presence, there exists  A virtue which irradiates and exalts  All objects through all intercourse of sense.  No outcast he, bewilder&amp;#39;d and depress&amp;#39;d;  Along his infant veins are interfus&amp;#39;d  The gravitation and the filial bond  Of nature, that connect him with the world.  Emphatically such a  Being lives,  An inmate of this active universe;  From nature largely he receives; nor so  Is satisfied, but largely gives again,  For feeling has to him imparted strength,  And powerful in all sentiments of grief,  Of exultation, fear, and joy, his mind,  Even as an agent of the one great mind,  Creates, creator and receiver both,  Working but in alliance with the works  Which it beholds.— Such, verily, is the first  Poetic spirit of our human life;  By uniform control of after years  In most abated or suppress&amp;#39;d, in some,  Through every change of growth or of decay,  Pre-eminent till death.  From early days,  Beginning not long after that first time  In which, a  Babe, by intercourse of touch,  I held mute dialogues with my  Mother&amp;#39;s heart  I have endeavour&amp;#39;d to display the means  Whereby this infant sensibility,  Great birthright of our  Being, was in me  Augmented and sustain&amp;#39;d.  Yet is a path  More difficult before me, and  I fear  That in its broken windings we shall need  The chamois&amp;#39; sinews, and the eagle&amp;#39;s wing:  For now a trouble came into my mind  From unknown causes.  I was left alone,  Seeking the visible world, nor knowing why.  The props of my affections were remov&amp;#39;d,  And yet the building stood, as if sustain&amp;#39;d  By its own spirit!  All that  I beheld  Was dear to me, and from this cause it came,  That now to  Nature&amp;#39;s finer influxes  My mind lay open, to that more exact  And intimate communion which our hearts  Maintain with the minuter properties  Of objects which already are belov&amp;#39;d,  And of those only.  Many are the joys  Of youth; but oh! what happiness to live  When every hour brings palpable access  Of knowledge, when all knowledge is delight,  And sorrow is not there.  The seasons came,  And every season to my notice brought  A store of transitory qualities  Which, but for this most watchful power of love  Had been neglected, left a register  Of permanent relations, else unknown,  Hence life, and change, and beauty, solitude  More active, even, than &amp;#39;best society&amp;#39;,  Society made sweet as solitude  By silent inobtrusive sympathies,  And gentle agitations of the mind  From manifold distinctions, difference  Perceived in things, where to the common eye,  No difference is; and hence, from the same source  Sublimer joy; for  I would walk alone,  In storm and tempest, or in starlight nights  Beneath the quiet  Heavens; and, at that time,  Have felt whate&amp;#39;er there is of power in sound  To breathe an elevated mood, by form  Or image unprofaned; and  I would stand,  Beneath some rock, listening to sounds that are  The ghostly language of the ancient earth,  Or make their dim abode in distant winds.  Thence did  I drink the visionary power.  I deem not profitless those fleeting moods  Of shadowy exultation: not for this,  That they are kindred to our purer mind  And intellectual life; but that the soul,  Remembering how she felt, but what she felt  Remembering not, retains an obscure sense  Of possible sublimity, to which,  With growing faculties she doth aspire,  With faculties still growing, feeling still  That whatsoever point they gain, they still  Have something to pursue.  And not alone,  In grandeur and in tumult, but no less  In tranquil scenes, that universal power  And fitness in the latent qualities  And essences of things, by which the mind  Is mov&amp;#39;d by feelings of delight, to me  Came strengthen&amp;#39;d with a superadded soul,  A virtue not its own.  My morning walks  Were early; oft, before the hours of  School  I travell&amp;#39;d round our little  Lake, five miles  Of pleasant wandering, happy time! more dear  For this, that one was by my side, a  Friend  Then passionately lov&amp;#39;d; with heart how full  Will he peruse these lines, this page, perhaps  A blank to other men! for many years  Have since flow&amp;#39;d in between us; and our minds,  Both silent to each other, at this time  We live as if those hours had never been.  Nor seldom did  I lift our cottage latch  Far earlier, and before the vernal thrush  Was audible, among the hills  I sate  Alone, upon some jutting eminence  At the first hour of morning, when the  Vale  Lay quiet in an utter solitude.  How shall  I trace the history, where seek  The origin of what  I then have felt?  Oft in these moments such a holy calm  Did overspread my soul, that  I forgot  That  I had bodily eyes, and what  I saw  Appear&amp;#39;d like something in myself, a dream,  A prospect in my mind. &amp;#39; Twere long to tell  What spring and autumn, what the winter snows,  And what the summer shade, what day and night,  The evening and the morning, what my dreams  And what my waking thoughts supplied, to nurse  That spirit of religious love in which  I walked with  Nature.  But let this, at least  Be not forgotten, that  I still retain&amp;#39;d  My first creative sensibility,  That by the regular action of the world  My soul was unsubdu&amp;#39;d.  A plastic power  Abode with me, a forming hand, at times  Rebellious, acting in a devious mood,  A local spirit of its own, at war  With general tendency, but for the most  Subservient strictly to the external things  With which it commun&amp;#39;d.  An auxiliar light  Came from my mind which on the setting sun  Bestow&amp;#39;d new splendor, the melodious birds,  The gentle breezes, fountains that ran on,  Murmuring so sweetly in themselves, obey&amp;#39;d  A like dominion; and the midnight storm  Grew darker in the presence of my eye.  Hence by obeisance, my devotion hence,  And hence my transport.  Nor should this, perchance,  Pass unrecorded, that  I still have lov&amp;#39;d  The exercise and produce of a toil  Than analytic industry to me  More pleasing, and whose character  I deem  Is more poetic as resembling more  Creative agency.  I mean to speak  Of that interminable building rear&amp;#39;d  By observation of affinities  In objects where no brotherhood exists  To common minds.  My seventeenth year was come  And, whether from this habit, rooted now  So deeply in my mind, or from excess  Of the great social principle of life,  Coercing all things into sympathy,  To unorganic natures  I transferr&amp;#39;d  My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth  Coming in revelation,  I convers&amp;#39;d  With things that really are,  I, at this time  Saw blessings spread around me like a sea.  Thus did my days pass on, and now at length  From  Nature and her overflowing soul  I had receiv&amp;#39;d so much that all my thoughts  Were steep&amp;#39;d in feeling;  I was only then  Contented when with bliss ineffable  I felt the sentiment of  Being spread  O&amp;#39;er all that moves, and all that seemeth still,  O&amp;#39;er all, that, lost beyond the reach of thought  And human knowledge, to the human eye  Invisible, yet liveth to the heart,  O&amp;#39;er all that leaps, and runs, and shouts, and sings,  Or beats the gladsome air, o&amp;#39;er all that glides  Beneath the wave, yea, in the wave itself  And mighty depth of waters.  Wonder not  If such my transports were; for in all things  I saw one life, and felt that it was joy.  One song they sang, and it was audible,  Most audible then when the fleshly ear,  O&amp;#39;ercome by grosser prelude of that strain,  Forgot its functions, and slept undisturb&amp;#39;d.  If this be error, and another faith  Find easier access to the pious mind,  Yet were  I grossly destitute of all  Those human sentiments which make this earth  So dear, if  I should fail, with grateful voice  To speak of you,  Ye  Mountains and  Ye  Lakes,  And sounding  Cataracts!  Ye  Mists and  Winds  That dwell among the hills where  I was born.  If, in my youth,  I have been pure in heart,  If, mingling with the world,  I am content  With my own modest pleasures, and have liv&amp;#39;d,  With  God and  Nature communing, remov&amp;#39;d  From little enmities and low desires,  The gift is yours; if in these times of fear,  This melancholy waste of hopes o&amp;#39;erthrown,  If, &amp;#39;mid indifference and apathy  And wicked exultation, when good men,  On every side fall off we know not how,  To selfishness, disguis&amp;#39;d in gentle names  Of peace, and quiet, and domestic love,  Yet mingled, not unwillingly, with sneers  On visionary minds; if in this time  Of dereliction and dismay,  I yet  Despair not of our nature; but retain  A more than  Roman confidence, a faith  That fails not, in all sorrow my support,  The blessing of my life, the gift is yours,  Ye mountains! thine,  O  Nature!  Thou hast fed  My lofty speculations; and in thee,  For this uneasy heart of ours  I find  A never-failing principle of joy,  And purest passion.  Thou, my  Friend! wert rear&amp;#39;d  In the great  City, &amp;#39;mid far other scenes;  But we, by different roads at length have gain&amp;#39;d  The self-same bourne.  And for this cause to  Thee  I speak, unapprehensive of contempt,  The insinuated scoff of coward tongues,  And all that silent language which so oft  In conversation betwixt man and man  Blots from the human countenance all trace  Of beauty and of love.  For  Thou hast sought  The truth in solitude, and  Thou art one,  The most intense of  Nature&amp;#39;s worshippers  In many things my  Brother, chiefly here  In this my deep devotion.  Fare  Thee well!  Health, and the quiet of a healthful mind  Attend thee! seeking oft the haunts of men,  And yet more often living with  Thyself,  And for  Thyself, so haply shall thy days  Be many, and a blessing to mankind.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; There was a roaring in the wind all night;  The rain came heavily and fell in floods;  But now the sun is rising calm and bright;  The birds are singing in the distant woods;  Over his own sweet voice the  Stock-dove broods;  The  Jay makes answer as the  Magpie chatters;  And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters.  All things that love the sun are out of doors;  The sky rejoices in the morning\&amp;#39;s birth;  The grass is bright with rain-drops;—on the moors  The hare is running races in her mirth;  And with her feet she from the plashy earth  Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun,  Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run.  I was a  Traveller then upon the moor;  I saw the hare that raced about with joy;  I heard the woods and distant waters roar;  Or heard them not, as happy as a boy:  The pleasant season did my heart employ:  My old remembrances went from me wholly;  And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy.  But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might  Of joys in minds that can no further go,  As high as we have mounted in delight  In our dejection do we sink as low;  To me that morning did it happen so;  And fears and fancies thick upon me came;  Dim sadness—and blind thoughts,  I knew not, nor could name.  I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky;  And  I bethought me of the playful hare:  Even such a happy  Child of earth am  I;  Even as these blissful creatures do  I fare;  Far from the world  I walk, and from all care;  But there may come another day to me—  Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty.  My whole life  I have lived in pleasant thought,  As if life\&amp;#39;s business were a summer mood;  As if all needful things would come unsought  To genial faith, still rich in genial good;  But how can  He expect that others should  Build for him, sow for him, and at his call  Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all?  I thought of  Chatterton, the marvellous  Boy,  The sleepless  Soul that perished in his pride;  Of  Him who walked in glory and in joy  Following his plough, along the mountain-side:  By our own spirits are we deified:  We  Poets in our youth begin in gladness;  But thereof come in the end despondency and madness.  Now, whether it were by peculiar grace,  A leading from above, a something given,  Yet it befell that, in this lonely place,  When  I with these untoward thoughts had striven,  Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven  I saw a  Man before me unawares:  The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs.  As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie  Couched on the bald top of an eminence;  Wonder to all who do the same espy,  By what means it could thither come, and whence;  So that it seems a thing endued with sense:  Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf  Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself;  Such seemed this  Man, not all alive nor dead,  Nor all asleep—in his extreme old age:  His body was bent double, feet and head  Coming together in life\&amp;#39;s pilgrimage;  As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage  Of sickness felt by him in times long past,  A more than human weight upon his frame had cast.  Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face,  Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood:  And, still as  I drew near with gentle pace,  Upon the margin of that moorish flood  Motionless as a cloud the old  Man stood,  That heareth not the loud winds when they call,  And moveth all together, if it move at all.  At length, himself unsettling, he the pond  Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look  Upon the muddy water, which he conned,  As if he had been reading in a book:  And now a stranger\&amp;#39;s privilege  I took;  And, drawing to his side, to him did say, &amp;quot; This morning gives us promise of a glorious day.&amp;quot;  A gentle answer did the old  Man make,  In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew:  And him with further words  I thus bespake, &amp;quot; What occupation do you there pursue?  This is a lonesome place for one like you.&amp;quot;  Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise  Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes.  His words came feebly, from a feeble chest,  But each in solemn order followed each,  With something of a lofty utterance drest—  Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach  Of ordinary men; a stately speech;  Such as grave  Livers do in  Scotland use,  Religious men, who give to  God and man their dues.  He told, that to these waters he had come  To gather leeches, being old and poor:  Employment hazardous and wearisome!  And he had many hardships to endure:  From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor;  Housing, with  God\&amp;#39;s good help, by choice or chance;  And in this way he gained an honest maintenance.  The old  Man still stood talking by my side;  But now his voice to me was like a stream  Scarce heard; nor word from word could  I divide;  And the whole body of the  Man did seem  Like one whom  I had met with in a dream;  Or like a man from some far region sent,  To give me human strength, by apt admonishment.  My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills;  And hope that is unwilling to be fed;  Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills;  And mighty  Poets in their misery dead. — Perplexed, and longing to be comforted,  My question eagerly did  I renew, &amp;quot; How is it that you live, and what is it you do?&amp;quot;  He with a smile did then his words repeat;  And said that, gathering leeches, far and wide  He travelled; stirring thus about his feet  The waters of the pools where they abide. &amp;quot; Once  I could meet with them on every side;  But they have dwindled long by slow decay;  Yet still  I persevere, and find them where  I may.&amp;quot;  While he was talking thus, the lonely place,  The old  Man\&amp;#39;s shape, and speech—all troubled me:  In my mind\&amp;#39;s eye  I seemed to see him pace  About the weary moors continually,  Wandering about alone and silently.  While  I these thoughts within myself pursued,  He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed.  And soon with this he other matter blended,  Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind,  But stately in the main; and, when he ended,  I could have laughed myself to scorn to find  In that decrepit  Man so firm a mind. &amp;quot; God,&amp;quot; said  I, &amp;quot;be my help and stay secure;  I\&amp;#39;ll think of the  Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; At the corner of  Wood  Street, when daylight appears,  Hangs a  Thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years:  Poor  Susan has passed by the spot, and has heard  In the silence of morning the song of the  Bird. &amp;#39; Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her?  She sees  A mountain ascending, a vision of trees;  Bright volumes of vapour through  Lothbury glide,  And a river flows on through the vale of  Cheapside.  Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale,  Down which she so often has tripped with her pail;  And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove&amp;#39;s,  The one only dwelling on earth that she loves.  She looks, and her heart is in heaven: but they fade,  The mist and the river, the hill and the shade:  The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise,  And the colours have all passed away from her eyes!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Scorn not the  Sonnet;  Critic, you have frowned,  Mindless of its just honours; with this key  Shakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody  Of this small lute gave ease to  Petrarch&amp;#39;s wound;  A thousand times this pipe did  Tasso sound;  With it  Camöens soothed an exile&amp;#39;s grief;  The  Sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf  Amid the cypress with which  Dante crowned  His visionary brow: a glow-worm lamp,  It cheered mild  Spenser, called from  Faery-land  To struggle through dark ways; and, when a damp  Fell round the path of  Milton, in his hand  The  Thing became a trumpet; whence he blew  Soul-animating strains—alas, too few!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Departing summer hath assumed  An aspect tenderly illumed,  The gentlest look of spring;  That calls from yonder leafy shade  Unfaded, yet prepared to fade,  A timely carolling.  No faint and hesitating trill,  Such tribute as to winter chill  The lonely redbreast pays!  Clear, loud, and lively is the din,  From social warblers gathering in  Their harvest of sweet lays.  Nor doth the example fail to cheer  Me, conscious that my leaf is sere,  And yellow on the bough:—  Fall, rosy garlands, from my head!  Ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance shed  Around a younger brow!  Yet will  I temperately rejoice;  Wide is the range, and free the choice  Of undiscordant themes;  Which, haply, kindred souls may prize  Not less than vernal ecstasies,  And passion&amp;#39;s feverish dreams.  For deathless powers to verse belong,  And they like  Demi-gods are strong  On whom the  Muses smile;  But some their function have disclaimed,  Best pleased with what is aptliest framed  To enervate and defile.  Not such the initiatory strains  Committed to the silent plains  In  Britain&amp;#39;s earliest dawn:  Trembled the groves, the stars grew pale,  While all-too-daringly the veil  Of nature was withdrawn!  Nor such the spirit-stirring note  When the live chords  Alcæus smote,  Inflamed by sense of wrong;  Woe! woe to  Tyrants! from the lyre  Broke threateningly, in sparkles dire  Of fierce vindictive song.  And not unhallowed was the page  By wingèd  Love inscribed, to assuage  The pangs of vain pursuit;  Love listening while the  Lesbian  Maid  With finest touch of passion swayed  Her own Æolian lute.  O ye, who patiently explore  The wreck of  Herculanean lore,  What rapture! could ye seize  Some  Theban fragment, or unroll  One precious, tender-hearted scroll  Of pure  Simonides.  That were, indeed, a genuine birth  Of poesy; a bursting forth  Of genius from the dust:  What  Horace gloried to behold,  What  Maro loved, shall we enfold?  Can haughty  Time be just!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; She dwelt among the untrodden ways  Beside the springs of  Dove,  A  Maid whom there were none to praise  And very few to love:  A violet by a mossy stone  Half hidden from the eye! — Fair as a star, when only one  Is shining in the sky.  She lived unknown, and few could know  When  Lucy ceased to be;  But she is in her grave, and, oh,  The difference to me!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; She was a  Phantom of delight  When first she gleamed upon my sight;  A lovely  Apparition, sent  To be a moment&amp;#39;s ornament;  Her eyes as stars of  Twilight fair;  Like  Twilight&amp;#39;s, too, her dusky hair;  But all things else about her drawn  From  May-time and the cheerful  Dawn;  A dancing  Shape, an  Image gay,  To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.  I saw her upon nearer view,  A  Spirit, yet a  Woman too!  Her household motions light and free,  And steps of virgin-liberty;  A countenance in which did meet  Sweet records, promises as sweet;  A  Creature not too bright or good  For human nature&amp;#39;s daily food;  For transient sorrows, simple wiles,  Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.  And now  I see with eye serene  The very pulse of the machine;  A  Being breathing thoughtful breath,  A  Traveller between life and death;  The reason firm, the temperate will,  Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;  A perfect  Woman, nobly planned,  To warn, to comfort, and command;  And yet a  Spirit still, and bright  With something of angelic light.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; In the sweet shire of  Cardigan,  Not far from pleasant  Ivor-hall,  An old  Man dwells, a little man,— \&amp;#39; Tis said he once was tall.  For five-and-thirty years he lived  A running huntsman merry;  And still the centre of his cheek  Is red as a ripe cherry.  No man like him the horn could sound,  And hill and valley rang with glee  When  Echo bandied, round and round  The halloo of  Simon  Lee.  In those proud days, he little cared  For husbandry or tillage;  To blither tasks did  Simon rouse  The sleepers of the village.  He all the country could outrun,  Could leave both man and horse behind;  And often, ere the chase was done,  He reeled, and was stone-blind.  And still there\&amp;#39;s something in the world  At which his heart rejoices;  For when the chiming hounds are out,  He dearly loves their voices!  But, oh the heavy change!—bereft  Of health, strength, friends, and kindred, see!  Old  Simon to the world is left  In liveried poverty.  His  Master\&amp;#39;s dead—and no one now  Dwells in the  Hall of  Ivor;  Men, dogs, and horses, all are dead;  He is the sole survivor.  And he is lean and he is sick;  His body, dwindled and awry,  Rests upon ankles swoln and thick;  His legs are thin and dry.  One prop he has, and only one,  His wife, an aged woman,  Lives with him, near the waterfall,  Upon the village  Common.  Beside their moss-grown hut of clay,  Not twenty paces from the door,  A scrap of land they have, but they  Are poorest of the poor.  This scrap of land he from the heath  Enclosed when he was stronger;  But what to them avails the land  Which he can till no longer?  Oft, working by her  Husband\&amp;#39;s side,  Ruth does what  Simon cannot do;  For she, with scanty cause for pride,  Is stouter of the two.  And, though you with your utmost skill  From labour could not wean them, \&amp;#39; Tis little, very little—all  That they can do between them.  Few months of life has he in store  As he to you will tell,  For still, the more he works, the more  Do his weak ankles swell.  My gentle  Reader,  I perceive,  How patiently you\&amp;#39;ve waited,  And now  I fear that you expect  Some tale will be related.  O  Reader! had you in your mind  Such stores as silent thought can bring,  O gentle  Reader! you would find  A tale in every thing.  What more  I have to say is short,  And you must kindly take it:  It is no tale; but, should you think,  Perhaps a tale you\&amp;#39;ll make it.  One summer-day  I chanced to see  This old  Man doing all he could  To unearth the root of an old tree,  A stump of rotten wood.  The mattock tottered in his hand;  So vain was his endeavour,  That at the root of the old tree  He might have worked for ever. &amp;quot; You\&amp;#39;re overtasked, good  Simon  Lee,  Give me your tool,&amp;quot; to him  I said;  And at the word right gladly he  Received my proffered aid.  I struck, and with a single blow  The tangled root  I severed,  At which the poor old  Man so long  And vainly had endeavoured.  The tears into his eyes were brought,  And thanks and praises seemed to run  So fast out of his heart,  I thought  They never would have done. — I\&amp;#39;ve heard of hearts unkind, kind deeds  With coldness still returning;  Alas! the gratitude of men  Hath oftener left me mourning.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;— Brook and road Were fellow-travellers in this gloomy  Pass, And with them did we journey several hours At a slow step.  The immeasurable height Of woods decaying, never to be decayed, The stationary blasts of waterfalls, And in the narrow rent, at every turn, Winds thwarting winds bewildered and forlorn, The torrents shooting from the clear blue sky, The rocks that muttered close upon our ears, Black drizzling crags that spake by the wayside As if a voice were in them, the sick sight And giddy prospect of the raving stream, The unfettered clouds and region of the heavens, Tumult and peace, the darkness and the light— Were all like workings of one mind, the features Of the same face, blossoms upon one tree, Characters of the great  Apocalypse, The types and symbols of  Eternity, Of first and last, and midst, and without end.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; A slumber did my spirit seal;  I had no human fears:  She seemed a thing that could not feel  The touch of earthly years.  No motion has she now, no force;  She neither hears nor sees;  Rolled round in earth&amp;#39;s diurnal course,  With rocks, and stones, and trees.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Behold her, single in the field,  Yon solitary  Highland  Lass!  Reaping and singing by herself;  Stop here, or gently pass!  Alone she cuts and binds the grain,  And sings a melancholy strain;  O listen! for the  Vale profound  Is overflowing with the sound.  No  Nightingale did ever chaunt  More welcome notes to weary bands  Of travellers in some shady haunt,  Among  Arabian sands:  A voice so thrilling ne&amp;#39;er was heard  In spring-time from the  Cuckoo-bird,  Breaking the silence of the seas  Among the farthest  Hebrides.  Will no one tell me what she sings?—  Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow  For old, unhappy, far-off things,  And battles long ago:  Or is it some more humble lay,  Familiar matter of to-day?  Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,  That has been, and may be again?  Whate&amp;#39;er the theme, the  Maiden sang  As if her song could have no ending;  I saw her singing at her work,  And o&amp;#39;er the sickle bending;—  I listened, motionless and still;  And, as  I mounted up the hill,  The music in my heart  I bore,  Long after it was heard no more.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; High in the breathless  Hall the  Minstrel sate,  And  Emont\&amp;#39;s murmur mingled with the  Song.—  The words of ancient time  I thus translate,  A festal strain that hath been silent long:— &amp;quot; From town to town, from tower to tower,  The red rose is a gladsome flower.  Her thirty years of winter past,  The red rose is revived at last;  She lifts her head for endless spring,  For everlasting blossoming:  Both roses flourish, red and white:  In love and sisterly delight  The two that were at strife are blended,  And all old troubles now are ended.—  Joy! joy to both! but most to her  Who is the flower of  Lancaster!  Behold her how  She smiles to-day  On this great throng, this bright array!  Fair greeting doth she send to all  From every corner of the hall;  But chiefly from above the board  Where sits in state our rightful  Lord,  A  Clifford to his own restored! &amp;quot; They came with banner, spear, and shield;  And it was proved in  Bosworth-field.  Not long the  Avenger was withstood—  Earth helped him with the cry of blood:  St.  George was for us, and the might  Of blessed  Angels crowned the right.  Loud voice the  Land has uttered forth,  We loudest in the faithful north:  Our fields rejoice, our mountains ring,  Our streams proclaim a welcoming;  Our strong-abodes and castles see  The glory of their loyalty. &amp;quot; How glad is  Skipton at this hour—  Though lonely, a deserted  Tower;  Knight, squire, and yeoman, page and groom,  We have them at the feast of  Brough\&amp;#39;m.  How glad  Pendragon—though the sleep  Of years be on her!— She shall reap  A taste of this great pleasure, viewing  As in a dream her own renewing.  Rejoiced is  Brough, right glad,  I deem,  Beside her little humble stream;  And she that keepeth watch and ward  Her statelier  Eden\&amp;#39;s course to guard;  They both are happy at this hour,  Though each is but a lonely  Tower:—  But here is perfect joy and pride  For one fair  House by  Emont\&amp;#39;s side,  This day, distinguished without peer,  To see her  Master and to cheer—  Him, and his  Lady-mother dear! &amp;quot; Oh! it was a time forlorn  When the fatherless was born—  Give her wings that she may fly,  Or she sees her infant die!  Swords that are with slaughter wild  Hunt the  Mother and the  Child.  Who will take them from the light? — Yonder is a man in sight—  Yonder is a house—but where?  No, they must not enter there.  To the caves, and to the brooks,  To the clouds of heaven she looks;  She is speechless, but her eyes  Pray in ghostly agonies.  Blissful  Mary,  Mother mild,  Maid and  Mother undefiled,  Save a  Mother and her  Child! &amp;quot; Now who is he that bounds with joy  On  Carrock\&amp;#39;s side, a  Shepherd-boy?  No thoughts hath he but thoughts that pass  Light as the wind along the grass.  Can this be  He who hither came  In secret, like a smothered flame?  O\&amp;#39;er whom such thankful tears were shed  For shelter, and a poor man\&amp;#39;s bread!  God loves the  Child; and  God hath willed  That those dear words should be fulfilled,  The  Lady\&amp;#39;s words, when forced away  The last she to her  Babe did say: &amp;quot; My own, my own, thy fellow-guest  I may not be; but rest thee, rest,  For lowly shepherd\&amp;#39;s life is best!&amp;quot; &amp;quot; Alas! when evil men are strong  No life is good, no pleasure long.  The  Boy must part from  Mosedale\&amp;#39;s groves,  And leave  Blencathara\&amp;#39;s rugged coves,  And quit the flowers that summer brings  To  Glenderamakin\&amp;#39;s lofty springs;  Must vanish, and his careless cheer  Be turned to heaviness and fear. — Give  Sir  Lancelot  Threlkeld praise!  Hear it, good man, old in days!  Thou tree of covert and of rest  For this young  Bird that is distrest;  Among thy branches safe he lay,  And he was free to sport and play,  When falcons were abroad for prey. &amp;quot; A recreant harp, that sings of fear  And heaviness in  Clifford\&amp;#39;s ear!  I said, when evil men are strong,  No life is good, no pleasure long,  A weak and cowardly untruth!  Our  Clifford was a happy  Youth,  And thankful through a weary time,  That brought him up to manhood\&amp;#39;s prime. — Again he wanders forth at will,  And tends a flock from hill to hill:  His garb is humble; ne\&amp;#39;er was seen  Such garb with such a noble mien;  Among the shepherd-grooms no mate  Hath he, a  Child of strength and state!  Yet lacks not friends for simple glee,  Nor yet for higher sympathy.  To his side the fallow-deer  Came and rested without fear;  The eagle, lord of land and sea,  Stooped down to pay him fealty;  And both the undying fish that swim  Through  Bowscale-tarn did wait on him;  The pair were servants of his eye  In their immortality;  And glancing, gleaming, dark or bright,  Moved to and fro, for his delight.  He knew the rocks which  Angels haunt  Upon the mountains visitant;  He hath kenned them taking wing:  And into caves where  Faeries sing  He hath entered; and been told  By  Voices how men lived of old.  Among the heavens his eye can see  The face of thing that is to be;  And, if that men report him right,  His tongue could whisper words of might. — Now another day is come,  Fitter hope, and nobler doom;  He hath thrown aside his crook,  And hath buried deep his book;  Armour rusting in his halls  On the blood of  Clifford calls,— \&amp;#39; Quell the  Scot,\&amp;#39; exclaims the  Lance—  Bear me to the heart of  France,  Is the longing of the  Shield—  Tell thy name, thou trembling field;  Field of death, where\&amp;#39;er thou be,  Groan thou with our victory!  Happy day, and mighty hour,  When our  Shepherd, in his power,  Mailed and horsed, with lance and sword,  To his ancestors restored  Like a re-appearing  Star,  Like a glory from afar  First shall head the flock of war!&amp;quot;  Alas! the impassioned minstrel did not know  How, by  Heaven\&amp;#39;s grace, this  Clifford\&amp;#39;s heart was framed:  How he, long forced in humble walks to go,  Was softened into feeling, soothed, and tamed.  Love had he found in huts where poor men lie;  His daily teachers had been woods and rills,  The silence that is in the starry sky,  The sleep that is among the lonely hills.  In him the savage virtue of the  Race,  Revenge and all ferocious thoughts were dead:  Nor did he change; but kept in lofty place  The wisdom which adversity had bred.  Glad were the vales, and every cottage-hearth;  The  Shepherd-lord was honoured more and more;  And, ages after he was laid in earth, &amp;quot; The good  Lord  Clifford&amp;quot; was the name he bore.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; I thought of  Thee, my partner and my guide, As being past away.— Vain sympathies! For, backward,  Duddon! as  I cast my eyes, I see what was, and is, and will abide; Still glides the  Stream, and shall for ever glide; The  Form remains, the  Function never dies; While we, the brave, the mighty, and the wise, We  Men, who in our morn of youth defied The elements, must vanish;—be it so! Enough, if something from our hands have power To live, and act, and serve the future hour; And if, as toward the silent tomb we go, Through love, through hope, and faith&amp;#39;s transcendent dower, We feel that we are greater than we know.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; Surprised by joy—impatient as the  Wind  I turned to share the transport— Oh! with whom  But  Thee, long buried in the silent  Tomb,  That spot which no vicissitude can find?  Love, faithful love, recalled thee to my mind—  But how could  I forget thee?— Through what power,  Even for the least division of an hour,  Have  I been so beguiled as to be blind  To my most grievous loss!— That thought’s return  Was the worst pang that sorrow ever bore,  Save one, one only, when  I stood forlorn,  Knowing my heart’s best treasure was no more;  That neither present time, nor years unborn  Could to my sight that heavenly face restore.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Up! up! my  Friend, and quit your books;  Or surely you&amp;#39;ll grow double:  Up! up! my  Friend, and clear your looks;  Why all this toil and trouble?  The sun above the mountain&amp;#39;s head,  A freshening lustre mellow  Through all the long green fields has spread,  His first sweet evening yellow.  Books! &amp;#39;tis a dull and endless strife:  Come, hear the woodland linnet,  How sweet his music! on my life,  There&amp;#39;s more of wisdom in it.  And hark! how blithe the throstle sings!  He, too, is no mean preacher:  Come forth into the light of things,  Let  Nature be your teacher.  She has a world of ready wealth,  Our minds and hearts to bless—  Spontaneous wisdom breathed by health,  Truth breathed by cheerfulness.  One impulse from a vernal wood  May teach you more of man,  Of moral evil and of good,  Than all the sages can.  Sweet is the lore which  Nature brings;  Our meddling intellect  Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:—  We murder to dissect.  Enough of  Science and of  Art;  Close up those barren leaves;  Come forth, and bring with you a heart  That watches and receives.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; There was a  Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs  And islands of  Winander! many a time,  At evening, when the earliest stars began  To move along the edges of the hills,  Rising or setting, would he stand alone,  Beneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;  And there, with fingers interwoven, both hands  Pressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth  Uplifted, he, as through an instrument,  Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls  That they might answer him.— And they would shout  Across the watery vale, and shout again,  Responsive to his call,—with quivering peals,  And long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud  Redoubled and redoubled; concourse wild  Of jocund din!  And, when there came a pause  Of silence such as baffled his best skill:  Then, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung  Listening, a gentle shock of mild surprise  Has carried far into his heart the voice  Of mountain-torrents; or the visible scene  Would enter unawares into his mind  With all its solemn imagery, its rocks,  Its woods, and that uncertain heaven received  Into the bosom of the steady lake.  This boy was taken from his mates, and died  In childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.  Pre-eminent in beauty is the vale  Where he was born and bred: the churchyard hangs  Upon a slope above the village-school;  And through that churchyard when my way has led  On summer-evenings,  I believe that there  A long half-hour together  I have stood  Mute—looking at the grave in which he lies!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; I“ There is a  Thorn—it looks so old, In truth, you’d find it hard to say How it could ever have been young, It looks so old and grey. Not higher than a two years&amp;#39; child It stands erect, this aged  Thorn; No leaves it has, no prickly points; It is a mass of knotted joints, A wretched thing forlorn. It stands erect, and like a stone With lichens is it overgrown.  I I“ Like rock or stone, it is o’ergrown, With lichens to the very top, And hung with heavy tufts of moss, A melancholy crop: Up from the earth these mosses creep, And this poor  Thorn they clasp it round So close, you’d say that they are bent With plain and manifest intent To drag it to the ground; And all have joined in one endeavour To bury this poor  Thorn for ever.  I I I“ High on a mountain’s highest ridge, Where oft the stormy winter gale Cuts like a scythe, while through the clouds It sweeps from vale to vale; Not five yards from the mountain path, This  Thorn you on your left espy; And to the left, three yards beyond, You see a little muddy pond Of water—never dry, Though but of compass small, and bare To thirsty suns and parching air.  I V“ And, close beside this aged  Thorn, There is a fresh and lovely sight, A beauteous heap, a hill of moss, Just half a foot in height. All lovely colours there you see, All colours that were ever seen; And mossy network too is there, As if by hand of lady fair The work had woven been; And cups, the darlings of the eye, So deep is their vermilion dye.  V“ Ah me! what lovely tints are there Of olive green and scarlet bright, In spikes, in branches, and in stars, Green, red, and pearly white! This heap of earth o’ergrown with moss, Which close beside the  Thorn you see, So fresh in all its beauteous dyes, Is like an infant’s grave in size, As like as like can be: But never, never any where, An infant’s grave was half so fair.  V I“ Now would you see this aged  Thorn, This pond, and beauteous hill of moss, You must take care and choose your time The mountain when to cross. For oft there sits between the heap, So like an infant’s grave in size, And that same pond of which  I spoke, A  Woman in a scarlet cloak, And to herself she cries,‘\ufeff Oh misery! oh misery! Oh woe is me! oh misery!’\ufeff  V I I“ At all times of the day and night This wretched  Woman thither goes; And she is known to every star, And every wind that blows; And there, beside the  Thorn, she sits When the blue daylight’s in the skies, And when the whirlwind’s on the hill, Or frosty air is keen and still, And to herself she cries,‘\ufeff Oh misery! oh misery! Oh woe is me! oh misery!’ ”  V I I I“ Now wherefore, thus, by day and night, In rain, in tempest, and in snow, Thus to the dreary mountain-top Does this poor  Woman go? And why sits she beside the  Thorn When the blue daylight’s in the sky Or when the whirlwind’s on the hill, Or frosty air is keen and still, And wherefore does she cry?— O wherefore? wherefore? tell me why Does she repeat that doleful cry?”  I X“ I cannot tell;  I wish  I could; For the true reason no one knows: But would you gladly view the spot, The spot to which she goes; The hillock like an infant’s grave, The pond—and  Thorn, so old and grey; Pass by her door—’tis seldom shut— And if you see her in her hut— Then to the spot away! I never heard of such as dare Approach the spot when she is there.”  X“ But wherefore to the mountain-top Can this unhappy  Woman go, Whatever star is in the skies, Whatever wind may blow?”“ Full twenty years are past and gone Since she (her name is  Martha  Ray) Gave with a maiden’s true good-will Her company to  Stephen  Hill; And she was blithe and gay, While friends and kindred all approved Of him whom tenderly she loved.  X I“ And they had fixed the wedding day, The morning that must wed them both; But  Stephen to another  Maid Had sworn another oath; And, with this other  Maid, to church Unthinking  Stephen went—  Poor  Martha! on that woeful day A pang of pitiless dismay Into her soul was sent; A fire was kindled in her breast, Which might not burn itself to rest.  X I I“ They say, full six months after this, While yet the summer leaves were green, She to the mountain-top would go, And there was often seen. What could she seek?—or wish to hide? Her state to any eye was plain; She was with child, and she was mad; Yet often was she sober sad From her exceeding pain. O guilty  Father—would that death Had saved him from that breach of faith!  X I I I“ Sad case for such a brain to hold Communion with a stirring child! Sad case, as you may think, for one Who had a brain so wild! Last  Christmas-eve we talked of this, And grey-haired  Wilfred of the glen Held that the unborn infant wrought About its mother’s heart, and brought Her senses back again: And, when at last her time drew near, Her looks were calm, her senses clear.  X I V“ More know  I not,  I wish  I did, And it should all be told to you; For what became of this poor child No mortal ever knew; Nay—if a child to her was born No earthly tongue could ever tell; And if ’twas born alive or dead, Far less could this with proof be said; But some remember well, That  Martha  Ray about this time Would up the mountain often climb.  X V“ And all that winter, when at night The wind blew from the mountain-peak,’ Twas worth your while, though in the dark, The churchyard path to seek: For many a time and oft were heard Cries coming from the mountain head: Some plainly living voices were; And others,  I’ve heard many swear, Were voices of the dead: I cannot think, whate’er they say, They had to do with  Martha  Ray.  X V I“ But that she goes to this old  Thorn, The  Thorn which  I described to you, And there sits in a scarlet cloak, I will be sworn is true. For one day with my telescope, To view the ocean wide and bright, When to this country first  I came, Ere  I had heard of  Martha’s name, I climbed the mountain’s height:— A storm came on, and  I could see No object higher than my knee.  X V I I“ ’ Twas mist and rain, and storm and rain: No screen, no fence could  I discover; And then the wind! in sooth, it was A wind full ten times over. I looked around,  I thought  I saw A jutting crag,—and off  I ran, Head-foremost, through the driving rain, The shelter of the crag to gain; And, as  I am a man, Instead of jutting crag,  I found A  Woman seated on the ground.  X V I I I“ I did not speak— I saw her face; Her face!—it was enough for me; I turned about and heard her cry,‘\ufeff Oh misery! oh misery!’\ufeff And there she sits, until the moon Through half the clear blue sky will go; And when the little breezes make The waters of the pond to shake, As all the country know, She shudders, and you hear her cry,‘\ufeff Oh misery! oh misery!’ ”  X I X“ But what’s the  Thorn? and what the pond? And what the hill of moss to her? And what the creeping breeze that comes The little pond to stir?”“ I cannot tell; but some will say She hanged her baby on the tree; Some say she drowned it in the pond, Which is a little step beyond: But all and each agree, The little  Babe was buried there, Beneath that hill of moss so fair.  X X“ I’ve heard, the moss is spotted red With drops of that poor infant’s blood; But kill a new-born infant thus, I do not think she could! Some say, if to the pond you go, And fix on it a steady view, The shadow of a babe you trace, A baby and a baby’s face, And that it looks at you; Whene’er you look on it, ’tis plain The baby looks at you again.  X X I“ And some had sworn an oath that she Should be to public justice brought; And for the little infant’s bones With spades they would have sought. But instantly the hill of moss Before their eyes began to stir! And, for full fifty yards around, The grass—it shook upon the ground! Yet all do still aver The little  Babe lies buried there, Beneath that hill of moss so fair.  X X I I“ I cannot tell how this may be, But plain it is the  Thorn is bound With heavy tufts of moss that strive To drag it to the ground; And this  I know, full many a time, When she was on the mountain high, By day, and in the silent night, When all the stars shone clear and bright, That  I have heard her cry,‘\ufeff Oh misery! oh misery! Oh woe is me! oh misery!’ ”&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; Three years she grew in sun and shower,  Then  Nature said, &amp;quot; A lovelier flower  On earth was never sown;  This  Child  I to myself will take;  She shall be mine, and  I will make  A  Lady of my own. &amp;quot; Myself will to my darling be  Both law and impulse: and with me  The  Girl, in rock and plain,  In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,  Shall feel an overseeing power  To kindle or restrain. &amp;quot; She shall be sportive as the fawn  That wild with glee across the lawn  Or up the mountain springs;  And hers shall be the breathing balm,  And hers the silence and the calm  Of mute insensate things. &amp;quot; The floating clouds their state shall lend  To her; for her the willow bend;  Nor shall she fail to see  Even in the motions of the  Storm  Grace that shall mould the  Maiden\&amp;#39;s form  By silent sympathy. &amp;quot; The stars of midnight shall be dear  To her; and she shall lean her ear  In many a secret place  Where rivulets dance their wayward round,  And beauty born of murmuring sound  Shall pass into her face. &amp;quot; And vital feelings of delight  Shall rear her form to stately height,  Her virgin bosom swell;  Such thoughts to  Lucy  I will give  While she and  I together live  Here in this happy dell.&amp;quot;  Thus  Nature spake— The work was done—  How soon my  Lucy\&amp;#39;s race was run!  She died, and left to me  This heath, this calm and quiet scene;  The memory of what has been,  And never more will be.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;( At  Inversneyde, upon  Loch  Lomond)  Sweet  Highland  Girl, a very shower  Of beauty is thy earthly dower!  Twice seven consenting years have shed  Their utmost bounty on thy head:  And these grey rocks; that household lawn;  Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;  This fall of water that doth make  A murmur near the silent lake;  This little bay; a quiet road  That holds in shelter thy  Abode—  In truth together do ye seem  Like something fashioned in a dream;  Such  Forms as from their covert peep  When earthly cares are laid asleep!  But,  O fair  Creature! in the light  Of common day, so heavenly bright,  I bless  Thee,  Vision as thou art,  I bless thee with a human heart;  God shield thee to thy latest years!  Thee, neither know  I, nor thy peers;  And yet my eyes are filled with tears.  With earnest feeling  I shall pray  For thee when  I am far away:  For never saw  I mien, or face,  In which more plainly  I could trace  Benignity and home-bred sense  Ripening in perfect innocence.  Here scattered, like a random seed,  Remote from men,  Thou dost not need  The embarrassed look of shy distress,  And maidenly shamefacedness:  Thou wear&amp;#39;st upon thy forehead clear  The freedom of a  Mountaineer:  A face with gladness overspread!  Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!  And seemliness complete, that sways  Thy courtesies, about thee plays;  With no restraint, but such as springs  From quick and eager visitings  Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach  Of thy few words of  English speech:  A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife  That gives thy gestures grace and life!  So have  I, not unmoved in mind,  Seen birds of tempest-loving kind—  Thus beating up against the wind.  What hand but would a garland cull  For thee who art so beautiful?  O happy pleasure! here to dwell  Beside thee in some heathy dell;  Adopt your homely ways, and dress,  A  Shepherd, thou a  Shepherdess!  But  I could frame a wish for thee  More like a grave reality:  Thou art to me but as a wave  Of the wild sea; and  I would have  Some claim upon thee, if  I could,  Though but of common neighbourhood.  What joy to hear thee, and to see!  Thy elder  Brother  I would be,  Thy  Father—anything to thee!  Now thanks to  Heaven! that of its grace  Hath led me to this lonely place.  Joy have  I had; and going hence  I bear away my recompense.  In spots like these it is we prize  Our  Memory, feel that she hath eyes:  Then, why should  I be loth to stir?  I feel this place was made for her;  To give new pleasure like the past,  Continued long as life shall last.  Nor am  I loth, though pleased at heart,  Sweet  Highland  Girl! from thee to part;  For  I, methinks, till  I grow old,  As fair before me shall behold,  As  I do now, the cabin small,  The lake, the bay, the waterfall;  And thee, the spirit of them all!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; Ethereal minstrel! pilgrim of the sky!  Dost thou despise the earth where cares abound?  Or, while the wings aspire, are heart and eye  Both with thy nest upon the dewy ground?  Thy nest which thou canst drop into at will,  Those quivering wings composed, that music still!  Leave to the nightingale her shady wood;  A privacy of glorious light is thine;  Whence thou dost pour upon the world a flood  Of harmony, with instinct more divine;  Type of the wise who soar, but never roam;  True to the kindred points of  Heaven and  Home!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; O blithe  New-comer!  I have heard,  I hear thee and rejoice.  O  Cuckoo! shall  I call thee  Bird,  Or but a wandering  Voice?  While  I am lying on the grass  Thy twofold shout  I hear;  From hill to hill it seems to pass,  At once far off, and near.  Though babbling only to the  Vale  Of sunshine and of flowers,  Thou bringest unto me a tale  Of visionary hours.  Thrice welcome, darling of the  Spring!  Even yet thou art to me  No bird, but an invisible thing,  A voice, a mystery;  The same whom in my school-boy days  I listened to; that  Cry  Which made me look a thousand ways  In bush, and tree, and sky.  To seek thee did  I often rove  Through woods and on the green;  And thou wert still a hope, a love;  Still longed for, never seen.  And  I can listen to thee yet;  Can lie upon the plain  And listen, till  I do beget  That golden time again.  O blessèd  Bird! the earth we pace  Again appears to be  An unsubstantial, faery place;  That is fit home for  Thee!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; Mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrost With the least shade of thought to sin allied. Woman! above all women glorified, Our tainted nature&amp;#39;s solitary boast; Purer than foam on central ocean tost; Brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewn With fancied roses, than the unblemished moon Before her wane begins on heaven&amp;#39;s blue coast; Thy image falls to earth.  Yet some,  I ween, Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend, As to a visible  Power, in which did blend All that was mixed and reconciled in thee Of mother&amp;#39;s love with maiden purity, Of high with low, celestial with terrene!&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;——— A simple  Child,  That lightly draws its breath,  And feels its life in every limb,  What should it know of death?  I met a little cottage  Girl:  She was eight years old, she said;  Her hair was thick with many a curl  That clustered round her head.  She had a rustic, woodland air,  And she was wildly clad:  Her eyes were fair, and very fair; — Her beauty made me glad. “ Sisters and brothers, little  Maid,  How many may you be?” “ How many?  Seven in all,” she said,  And wondering looked at me. “ And where are they?  I pray you tell.”  She answered, “ Seven are we;  And two of us at  Conway dwell,  And two are gone to sea. “ Two of us in the church-yard lie,  My sister and my brother;  And, in the church-yard cottage,  I  Dwell near them with my mother.” “ You say that two at  Conway dwell,  And two are gone to sea,  Yet ye are seven!  I pray you tell,  Sweet  Maid, how this may be.”  Then did the little  Maid reply, “ Seven boys and girls are we;  Two of us in the church-yard lie,  Beneath the church-yard tree.” “ You run about, my little  Maid,  Your limbs they are alive;  If two are in the church-yard laid,  Then ye are only five.” “ Their graves are green, they may be seen,”  The little  Maid replied, “ Twelve steps or more from my mother’s door,  And they are side by side. “ My stockings there  I often knit,  My kerchief there  I hem;  And there upon the ground  I sit,  And sing a song to them. “ And often after sun-set,  Sir,  When it is light and fair,  I take my little porringer,  And eat my supper there. “ The first that died was sister  Jane;  In bed she moaning lay,  Till  God released her of her pain;  And then she went away. “ So in the church-yard she was laid;  And, when the grass was dry,  Together round her grave we played,  My brother  John and  I. “ And when the ground was white with snow,  And  I could run and slide,  My brother  John was forced to go,  And he lies by her side.” “ How many are you, then,” said  I, “ If they two are in heaven?”  Quick was the little  Maid’s reply, “ O  Master! we are seven.” “ But they are dead; those two are dead!  Their spirits are in heaven!” ’ Twas throwing words away; for still  The little  Maid would have her will,  And said, “ Nay, we are seven!”&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; Why art thou silent!  Is thy love a plant  Of such weak fibre that the treacherous air  Of absence withers what was once so fair?  Is there no debt to pay, no boon to grant?  Yet have my thoughts for thee been vigilant—  Bound to thy service with unceasing care,  The mind’s least generous wish a mendicant  For nought but what thy happiness could spare.  Speak— though this soft warm heart, once free to hold  A thousand tender pleasures, thine and mine,  Be left more desolate, more dreary cold  Than a forsaken bird’s-nest filled with snow ‘ Mid its own bush of leafless eglantine—  Speak, that my torturing doubts their end may know.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; The world is too much with us; late and soon,  Getting and spending, we lay waste our powers;—  Little we see in  Nature that is ours;  We have given our hearts away, a sordid boon!  This  Sea that bares her bosom to the moon;  The winds that will be howling at all hours,  And are up-gathered now like sleeping flowers;  For this, for everything, we are out of tune;  It moves us not.  Great  God!  I’d rather be  A  Pagan suckled in a creed outworn;  So might  I, standing on this pleasant lea,  Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;  Have sight of  Proteus rising from the sea;  Or hear old  Triton blow his wreathèd horn.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; O  Friend!  I know not which way  I must look For comfort, being, as  I am, opprest, To think that now our life is only drest For show; mean handy-work of craftsman, cook, Or groom! —  We must run glittering like a brook In the open sunshine, or we are unblest: The wealthiest man among us is the best: No grandeur now in nature or in book Delights us.  Rapine, avarice, expense, This is idolatry; and these we adore: Plain living and high thinking are no more: The homely beauty of the good old cause Is gone; our peace, our fearful innocence, And pure religion breathing household laws.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; The gallant  Youth, who may have gained,  Or seeks, a &amp;quot;winsome  Marrow,&amp;quot;  Was but an  Infant in the lap  When first  I looked on  Yarrow;  Once more, by  Newark\&amp;#39;s  Castle-gate  Long left without a warder,  I stood, looked, listened, and with  Thee,  Great  Minstrel of the  Border!  Grave thoughts ruled wide on that sweet day,  Their dignity installing  In gentle bosoms, while sere leaves  Were on the bough, or falling;  But breezes played, and sunshine gleamed-  The forest to embolden;  Reddened the fiery hues, and shot  Transparence through the golden.  For busy thoughts the  Stream flowed on  In foamy agitation;  And slept in many a crystal pool  For quiet contemplation:  No public and no private care  The freeborn mind enthralling,  We made a day of happy hours,  Our happy days recalling.  Brisk  Youth appeared, the  Morn of youth,  With freaks of graceful folly,-  Life\&amp;#39;s temperate  Noon, her sober  Eve,  Her  Night not melancholy;  Past, present, future, all appeared  In harmony united,  Like guests that meet, and some from far,  By cordial love invited.  And if, as  Yarrow, through the woods  And down the meadow ranging,  Did meet us with unaltered face,  Though we were changed and changing;  If, then, some natural shadows spread  Our inward prospect over,  The soul\&amp;#39;s deep valley was not slow  Its brightness to recover.  Eternal blessings on the  Muse,  And her divine employment!  The blameless  Muse, who trains her  Sons  For hope and calm enjoyment;  Albeit sickness, lingering yet,  Has o\&amp;#39;er their pillow brooded;  And  Care waylays their steps-a  Sprite  Not easily eluded.  For thee,  O  Scott! compelled to change  Green  Eildon-hill and  Cheviot  For warm  Vesuvio\&amp;#39;s vine-clad slopes;  And leave thy  Tweed and  Tiviot  For mild  Sorrento\&amp;#39;s breezy waves;  May classic  Fancy, linking  With native  Fancy her fresh aid,  Preserve thy heart from sinking!  Oh! while they minister to thee,  Each vying with the other,  May  Health return to mellow  Age  With  Strength, her venturous brother;  And  Tiber, and each brook and rill  Renowned in song and story,  With unimagined beauty shine,  Nor lose one ray of glory!  For  Thou, upon a hundred streams,  By tales of love and sorrow,  Of faithful love, undaunted truth  Hast shed the power of  Yarrow;  And streams unknown, hills yet unseen,  Wherever they invite  Thee,  At parent  Nature\&amp;#39;s grateful call,  With gladness must requite  Thee.  A gracious welcome shall be thine,  Such looks of love and honour  As thy own  Yarrow gave to me  When first  I gazed upon her;  Beheld what  I had feared to see,  Unwilling to surrender  Dreams treasured up from early days,  The holy and the tender.  And what, for this frail world, were all  That mortals do or suffer,  Did no responsive harp, no pen,  Memorial tribute offer?  Yea, what were mighty  Nature\&amp;#39;s self?  Her features, could they win us,  Unhelped by the poetic voice  That hourly speaks within us?  Nor deem that localized  Romance  Plays false with our affections;  Unsanctifies our tears-made sport  For fanciful dejections:  Ah, no! the visions of the past  Sustain the heart in feeling  Life as she is-our changeful  Life,  With friends and kindred dealing.  Bear witness,  Ye, whose thoughts that day  In  Yarrow\&amp;#39;s groves were centred;  Who through the silent portal arch  Of mouldering  Newark entered;  And clomb the winding stair that once  Too timidly was mounted  By the &amp;quot;last  Minstrel,&amp;quot;(not the last!)  Ere he his  Tale recounted.  Flow on for ever,  Yarrow  Stream!  Fulfil thy pensive duty,  Well pleased that future  Bards should chant  For simple hearts thy beauty;  To dream-light dear while yet unseen,  Dear to the common sunshine,  And dearer still, as now  I feel,  To memory\&amp;#39;s shadowy moonshine!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39; From  Stirling castle we had seen The mazy  Forth unravelled; Had trod the banks of  Clyde, and  Tay, And with the  Tweed had travelled; And when we came to  Clovenford, Then said my &amp;quot;winsome  Marrow ,&amp;quot;&amp;quot; Whate\&amp;#39;er betide, we\&amp;#39;ll turn aside, And see the  Braes of  Yarrow.&amp;quot;&amp;quot; Let  Yarrow folk, frae  Selkirk town, Who have been buying, selling, Go back to  Yarrow, \&amp;#39;tis their own; Each maiden to her dwelling! On  Yarrow\&amp;#39;s banks let her herons feed, Hares couch, and rabbits burrow! But we will downward with the  Tweed Nor turn aside to  Yarrow.&amp;quot; There\&amp;#39;s  Galla  Water,  Leader  Haughs, Both lying right before us; And  Dryborough, where with chiming  Tweed The lintwhites sing in chorus; There\&amp;#39;s pleasant  Tiviot-dale, a land Made blithe with plough and harrow: Why throw away a needful day To go in search of  Yarrow?&amp;quot; What\&amp;#39;s  Yarrow but a river bare, That glides the dark hills under? There are a thousand such elsewhere As worthy of your wonder.&amp;quot;— Strange words they seemed of slight and scorn; My  True-love sighed for sorrow; And looked me in the face, to think I thus could speak of  Yarrow!&amp;quot; Oh! green,&amp;quot; said  I, &amp;quot;are  Yarrow\&amp;#39;s holms, And sweet is  Yarrow flowing! Fair hangs the apple frae the rock, But we will leave it growing. O\&amp;#39;er hilly path, and open  Strath, We\&amp;#39;ll wander  Scotland thorough; But, though so near, we will not turn Into the dale of  Yarrow.&amp;quot; Let beeves and home-bred kine partake The sweets of  Burn-mill meadow, The swan on still  St.  Mary\&amp;#39;s  Lake Float double, swan and shadow! We will not see them; will not go, To-day, nor yet to-morrow; Enough if in our hearts we know There\&amp;#39;s such a place as  Yarrow.&amp;quot; Be  Yarrow stream unseen, unknown! It must, or we shall rue it: We have a vision of our own; Ah! why should we undo it? The treasured dreams of times long past, We\&amp;#39;ll keep them, winsome  Marrow! For when we\&amp;#39;er there, although \&amp;#39;tis fair,\&amp;#39; Twill be another  Yarrow!&amp;quot; If  Care with freezing years should come, And wandering seem but folly,— Should we be loth to stir from home, And yet be melancholy; Should life be dull, and spirits low,\&amp;#39; Twill soothe us in our sorrow, That earth has something yet to show, The bonny holms of  Yarrow!&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot; And is this— Yarrow?— This the stream  Of which my fancy cherished,  So faithfully, a waking dream?  An image that hath perished!  O that some  Minstrel&amp;#39;s harp were near,  To utter notes of gladness,  And chase this silence from the air,  That fills my heart with sadness!  Yet why?—a silvery current flows  With uncontrolled meanderings;  Nor have these eyes by greener hills  Been soothed, in all my wanderings.  And, through her depths,  Saint  Mary&amp;#39;s  Lake  Is visibly delighted;  For not a feature of those hills  Is in the mirror slighted.  A blue sky bends o&amp;#39;er  Yarrow vale,  Save where that pearly whiteness  Is round the rising sun diffused,  A tender hazy brightness;  Mild dawn of promise! that excludes  All profitless dejection;  Though not unwilling here to admit  A pensive recollection.  Where was it that the famous  Flower  Of  Yarrow  Vale lay bleeding?  His bed perchance was yon smooth mound  On which the herd is feeding:  And haply from this crystal pool,  Now peaceful as the morning,  The  Water-wraith ascended thrice—  And gave his doleful warning.  Delicious is the  Lay that sings  The haunts of happy  Lovers,  The path that leads them to the grove,  The leafy grove that covers:  And  Pity sanctifies the  Verse  That paints, by strength of sorrow,  The unconquerable strength of love;  Bear witness, rueful  Yarrow!  But thou, that didst appear so fair  To fond imagination,  Dost rival in the light of day  Her delicate creation:  Meek loveliness is round thee spread,  A softness still and holy;  The grace of forest charms decayed,  And pastoral melancholy.  That region left, the vale unfolds  Rich groves of lofty stature,  With  Yarrow winding through the pomp  Of cultivated nature;  And, rising from those lofty groves,  Behold a  Ruin hoary!  The shattered front of  Newark&amp;#39;s  Towers,  Renowned in  Border story.  Fair scenes for childhood&amp;#39;s opening bloom,  For sportive youth to stray in;  For manhood to enjoy his strength;  And age to wear away in!  Yon cottage seems a bower of bliss,  A covert for protection  Of tender thoughts, that nestle there—  The brood of chaste affection.  How sweet, on this autumnal day,  The wild-wood fruits to gather,  And on my  True-love&amp;#39;s forehead plant  A crest of blooming heather!  And what if  I enwreathed my own! &amp;#39; Twere no offence to reason;  The sober  Hills thus deck their brows  To meet the wintry season.  I see—but not by sight alone,  Loved  Yarrow, have  I won thee;  A ray of fancy still survives—  Her sunshine plays upon thee!  Thy ever-youthful waters keep  A course of lively pleasure;  And gladsome notes my lips can breathe,  Accordant to the measure.  The vapours linger round the  Heights,  They melt, and soon must vanish;  One hour is theirs, nor more is mine—  Sad thought, which  I would banish,  But that  I know, where&amp;#39;er  I go,  Thy genuine image,  Yarrow!  Will dwell with me—to heighten joy,  And cheer my mind in sorrow.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Finally, the cleaned list of poems will be fitted into a Pandas dataframe with two columns--poems and author.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heav&amp;#39;ns joy, Sphear-born harmonious Sisters, Voice, and Vers, Wed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ Dead things with inbreath&amp;#39;d sense able to pierce, And to our high-rais&amp;#39;d phantasie present, That undisturbèd Song of pure content, Ay sung before the saphire-colour&amp;#39;d throne To him that sits theron With Saintly shout, and solemn Jubily, Where the bright Seraphim in burning row Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow, And the Cherubick host in thousand quires Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires, With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms, Hymns devout and holy Psalms Singing everlastingly; That we on Earth with undiscording voice May rightly answer that melodious noise; As once we did, till disproportion&amp;#39;d sin Jarr&amp;#39;d against natures chime, and with harsh din Broke the fair musick that all creatures made To their great Lord, whose love their motion sway’d In perfect Diapason, whilst they stood In first obedience, and their state of good. O may we soon again renew that Song And keep in tune with Heav&amp;#39;n, till God ere long To his celestial consort us unite, To live with him, and sing in endles morn of light.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hail native language, that by sinews weak Didst move my first endeavouring tongue to speak, And mad&amp;#39;st imperfect words with childish trips, Half unpronounc&amp;#39;d, slide through my infant lips, Driving dumb Silence from the portal door, Where he had mutely sate two years before: Here I salute thee and thy pardon ask, That now I use thee in my latter task: Small loss it is that thence can come unto thee, I know my tongue but little grace can do thee: Thou needst not be ambitious to be first, Believe me I have thither pack&amp;#39;d the worst: And, if it happen as I did forecast, The daintest dishes shall be serv&amp;#39;d up last. I pray thee then deny me not thy aid For this same small neglect that I have made: But haste thee straight to do me once a pleasure, And from thy wardrobe bring thy chiefest treasure; Not those new-fangled toys, and trimming slight Which takes our late fantastics with delight, But cull those richest robes, and gay&amp;#39;st attire Which deepest spirits, and choicest wits desire. I have some naked thoughts that rove about And loudly knock to have their passage out; And weary of their place do only stay Till thou hast deck&amp;#39;d them in thy best array; That so they may without suspect or fears Fly swiftly to this fair assembly&amp;#39;s ears. Yet I had rather, if I were to choose, Thy service in some graver subject use, Such as may make thee search thy coffers round, Before thou clothe my fancy in fit sound: Such where the deep transported mind may soar Above the wheeling poles, and at heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s door Look in, and see each blissful deity How he before the thunderous throne doth lie, Listening to what unshorn Apollo sings To th&amp;#39;touch of golden wires, while Hebe brings Immortal nectar to her kingly sire; Then passing through the spheres of watchful fire, And misty regions of wide air next under, And hills of snow and lofts of piled thunder, May tell at length how green-ey&amp;#39;d Neptune raves, In heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s defiance mustering all his waves; Then sing of secret things that came to pass When beldam Nature in her cradle was; And last of kings and queens and heroes old, Such as the wise Demodocus once told In solemn songs at king Alcinous&amp;#39; feast, While sad Ulysses&amp;#39; soul and all the rest Are held with his melodious harmony In willing chains and sweet captivity.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hence vain deluding Joys, The brood of Folly without father bred, How little you bested, Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys; Dwell in some idle brain, And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess, As thick and numberless As the gay motes that people the sunbeams, Or likest hovering dreams, The fickle pensioners of Morpheus&amp;#39; train. But hail thou goddess, sage and holy, Hail divinest Melancholy, Whose saintly visage is too bright To hit the sense of human sight; And therefore to our weaker view, O&amp;#39;er-laid with black, staid Wisdom&amp;#39;s hue; Black, but such as in esteem, Prince Memnon&amp;#39;s sister might beseem, Or that starr&amp;#39;d Ethiop queen that strove To set her beauty&amp;#39;s praise above The sea nymphs, and their powers offended. Yet thou art higher far descended, Thee bright-hair&amp;#39;d Vesta long of yore, To solitary Saturn bore; His daughter she (in Saturn&amp;#39;s reign, Such mixture was not held a stain) Oft in glimmering bow&amp;#39;rs and glades He met her, and in secret shades Of woody Ida&amp;#39;s inmost grove, While yet there was no fear of Jove. Come pensive nun, devout and pure, Sober, stedfast, and demure, All in a robe of darkest grain, Flowing with majestic train, And sable stole of cypress lawn, Over thy decent shoulders drawn. Come, but keep thy wonted state, With ev&amp;#39;n step, and musing gait, And looks commercing with the skies, Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes: There held in holy passion still, Forget thyself to marble, till With a sad leaden downward cast, Thou fix them on the earth as fast. And join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet, Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet, And hears the Muses in a ring, Aye round about Jove&amp;#39;s altar sing. And add to these retired Leisure, That in trim gardens takes his pleasure; But first, and chiefest, with thee bring Him that yon soars on golden wing, Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne, The cherub Contemplation; And the mute Silence hist along, &amp;#39;Less Philomel will deign a song, In her sweetest, saddest plight, Smoothing the rugged brow of night, While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke, Gently o&amp;#39;er th&amp;#39; accustom&amp;#39;d oak. Sweet bird that shunn&amp;#39;st the noise of folly, Most musical, most melancholy! Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among, I woo to hear thy even-song; And missing thee, I walk unseen On the dry smooth-shaven green, To behold the wand&amp;#39;ring Moon, Riding near her highest noon, Like one that had been led astray Through the heav&amp;#39;ns wide pathless way; And oft, as if her head she bow&amp;#39;d, Stooping through a fleecy cloud. Oft on a plat of rising ground, I hear the far-off curfew sound, Over some wide-water&amp;#39;d shore, Swinging slow with sullen roar; Or if the air will not permit, Some still removed place will fit, Where glowing embers through the room Teach light to counterfeit a gloom, Far from all resort of mirth, Save the cricket on the hearth, Or the bellman&amp;#39;s drowsy charm, To bless the doors from nightly harm. Or let my lamp at midnight hour, Be seen in some high lonely tow&amp;#39;r, Where I may oft out-watch the Bear, With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere The spirit of Plato, to unfold What worlds, or what vast regions hold The immortal mind that hath forsook Her mansion in this fleshly nook: And of those dæmons that are found In fire, air, flood, or under ground, Whose power hath a true consent With planet, or with element. Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy In sceptr&amp;#39;d pall come sweeping by, Presenting Thebes&amp;#39;, or Pelop&amp;#39;s line, Or the tale of Troy divine, Or what (though rare) of later age, Ennobled hath the buskin&amp;#39;d stage. But, O sad Virgin, that thy power Might raise Musæus from his bower, Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing Such notes as, warbled to the string, Drew iron tears down Pluto&amp;#39;s cheek, And made Hell grant what love did seek. Or call up him that left half told The story of Cambuscan bold, Of Camball, and of Algarsife, And who had Canace to wife, That own&amp;#39;d the virtuous ring and glass, And of the wond&amp;#39;rous horse of brass, On which the Tartar king did ride; And if aught else, great bards beside, In sage and solemn tunes have sung, Of tourneys and of trophies hung, Of forests, and enchantments drear, Where more is meant than meets the ear. Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career, Till civil-suited Morn appear, Not trick&amp;#39;d and frounc&amp;#39;d as she was wont, With the Attic boy to hunt, But kerchief&amp;#39;d in a comely cloud, While rocking winds are piping loud, Or usher&amp;#39;d with a shower still, When the gust hath blown his fill, Ending on the rustling leaves, With minute-drops from off the eaves. And when the Sun begins to fling His flaring beams, me, goddess, bring To arched walks of twilight groves, And shadows brown that Sylvan loves, Of pine, or monumental oak, Where the rude axe with heaved stroke, Was never heard the nymphs to daunt, Or fright them from their hallow&amp;#39;d haunt. There in close covert by some brook, Where no profaner eye may look, Hide me from Day&amp;#39;s garish eye, While the bee with honied thigh, That at her flow&amp;#39;ry work doth sing, And the waters murmuring With such consort as they keep, Entice the dewy-feather&amp;#39;d sleep; And let some strange mysterious dream, Wave at his wings, in airy stream Of lively portraiture display&amp;#39;d, Softly on my eye-lids laid. And as I wake, sweet music breathe Above, about, or underneath, Sent by some spirit to mortals good, Or th&amp;#39; unseen Genius of the wood. But let my due feet never fail To walk the studious cloister&amp;#39;s pale, And love the high embowed roof, With antique pillars massy proof, And storied windows richly dight, Casting a dim religious light. There let the pealing organ blow, To the full-voic&amp;#39;d quire below, In service high, and anthems clear, As may with sweetness, through mine ear, Dissolve me into ecstasies, And bring all Heav&amp;#39;n before mine eyes. And may at last my weary age Find out the peaceful hermitage, The hairy gown and mossy cell, Where I may sit and rightly spell Of every star that Heav&amp;#39;n doth shew, And every herb that sips the dew; Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain. These pleasures, Melancholy, give, And I with thee will choose to live.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hence loathed Melancholy, Of Cerberus, and blackest Midnight born, In Stygian cave forlorn, &amp;#39;Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy; Find out some uncouth cell, Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings, And the night-raven sings; There under ebon shades, and low-brow&amp;#39;d rocks, As ragged as thy locks, In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell. But come thou goddess fair and free, In heav&amp;#39;n yclep&amp;#39;d Euphrosyne, And by men, heart-easing Mirth, Whom lovely Venus at a birth With two sister Graces more To Ivy-crowned Bacchus bore; Or whether (as some sager sing) The frolic wind that breathes the spring, Zephyr, with Aurora playing, As he met her once a-Maying, There on beds of violets blue, And fresh-blown roses wash&amp;#39;d in dew, Fill&amp;#39;d her with thee, a daughter fair, So buxom, blithe, and debonair. Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee Jest and youthful Jollity, Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles, Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles, Such as hang on Hebe&amp;#39;s cheek, And love to live in dimple sleek; Sport that wrinkled Care derides, And Laughter holding both his sides. Come, and trip it as ye go On the light fantastic toe, And in thy right hand lead with thee, The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty; And if I give thee honour due, Mirth, admit me of thy crew To live with her, and live with thee, In unreproved pleasures free; To hear the lark begin his flight, And singing startle the dull night, From his watch-tower in the skies, Till the dappled dawn doth rise; Then to come in spite of sorrow, And at my window bid good-morrow, Through the sweet-briar, or the vine, Or the twisted eglantine; While the cock with lively din, Scatters the rear of darkness thin, And to the stack, or the barn door, Stoutly struts his dames before; Oft list&amp;#39;ning how the hounds and horn Cheerly rouse the slumb&amp;#39;ring morn, From the side of some hoar hill, Through the high wood echoing shrill. Sometime walking, not unseen, By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green, Right against the eastern gate, Where the great Sun begins his state, Rob&amp;#39;d in flames, and amber light, The clouds in thousand liveries dight. While the ploughman near at hand, Whistles o&amp;#39;er the furrow&amp;#39;d land, And the milkmaid singeth blithe, And the mower whets his scythe, And every shepherd tells his tale Under the hawthorn in the dale. Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures Whilst the landskip round it measures, Russet lawns, and fallows gray, Where the nibbling flocks do stray; Mountains on whose barren breast The labouring clouds do often rest; Meadows trim with daisies pied, Shallow brooks, and rivers wide. Towers, and battlements it sees Bosom&amp;#39;d high in tufted trees, Where perhaps some beauty lies, The cynosure of neighbouring eyes. Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, From betwixt two aged oaks, Where Corydon and Thyrsis met, Are at their savoury dinner set Of herbs, and other country messes, Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses; And then in haste her bow&amp;#39;r she leaves, With Thestylis to bind the sheaves; Or if the earlier season lead To the tann&amp;#39;d haycock in the mead. Sometimes with secure delight The upland hamlets will invite, When the merry bells ring round, And the jocund rebecks sound To many a youth, and many a maid, Dancing in the chequer&amp;#39;d shade; And young and old come forth to play On a sunshine holiday, Till the live-long daylight fail; Then to the spicy nut-brown ale, With stories told of many a feat, How Faery Mab the junkets eat, She was pinch&amp;#39;d and pull&amp;#39;d she said, And he by friar&amp;#39;s lanthorn led, Tells how the drudging goblin sweat, To earn his cream-bowl duly set, When in one night, ere glimpse of morn, His shadowy flail hath thresh&amp;#39;d the corn That ten day-labourers could not end; Then lies him down, the lubber fiend, And stretch&amp;#39;d out all the chimney&amp;#39;s length, Basks at the fire his hairy strength; And crop-full out of doors he flings, Ere the first cock his matin rings. Thus done the tales, to bed they creep, By whispering winds soon lull&amp;#39;d asleep. Tower&amp;#39;d cities please us then, And the busy hum of men, Where throngs of knights and barons bold, In weeds of peace high triumphs hold, With store of ladies, whose bright eyes Rain influence, and judge the prize Of wit, or arms, while both contend To win her grace, whom all commend. There let Hymen oft appear In saffron robe, with taper clear, And pomp, and feast, and revelry, With mask, and antique pageantry; Such sights as youthful poets dream On summer eves by haunted stream. Then to the well-trod stage anon, If Jonson&amp;#39;s learned sock be on, Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy&amp;#39;s child, Warble his native wood-notes wild. And ever against eating cares, Lap me in soft Lydian airs, Married to immortal verse, Such as the meeting soul may pierce In notes with many a winding bout Of linked sweetness long drawn out, With wanton heed, and giddy cunning, The melting voice through mazes running, Untwisting all the chains that tie The hidden soul of harmony; That Orpheus&amp;#39; self may heave his head From golden slumber on a bed Of heap&amp;#39;d Elysian flow&amp;#39;rs, and hear Such strains as would have won the ear Of Pluto, to have quite set free His half-regain&amp;#39;d Eurydice. These delights if thou canst give, Mirth, with thee I mean to live.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere, I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, And with forc\&amp;#39;d fingers rude Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year. Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear Compels me to disturb your season due; For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime, Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer. Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme. He must not float upon his wat\&amp;#39;ry bier Unwept, and welter to the parching wind, Without the meed of some melodious tear. Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring; Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string. Hence with denial vain and coy excuse! So may some gentle muse With lucky words favour my destin\&amp;#39;d urn, And as he passes turn And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud! For we were nurs\&amp;#39;d upon the self-same hill, Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill; Together both, ere the high lawns appear\&amp;#39;d Under the opening eyelids of the morn, We drove afield, and both together heard What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn, Batt\&amp;#39;ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night, Oft till the star that rose at ev\&amp;#39;ning bright Toward heav\&amp;#39;n\&amp;#39;s descent had slop\&amp;#39;d his westering wheel. Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute, Temper\&amp;#39;d to th\&amp;#39;oaten flute; Rough Satyrs danc\&amp;#39;d, and Fauns with clov\&amp;#39;n heel, From the glad sound would not be absent long; And old Damætas lov\&amp;#39;d to hear our song. But O the heavy change now thou art gone, Now thou art gone, and never must return! Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves, With wild thyme and the gadding vine o\&amp;#39;ergrown, And all their echoes mourn. The willows and the hazel copses green Shall now no more be seen Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays. As killing as the canker to the rose, Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze, Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear When first the white thorn blows: Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd\&amp;#39;s ear. Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep Clos\&amp;#39;d o\&amp;#39;er the head of your lov\&amp;#39;d Lycidas? For neither were ye playing on the steep Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie, Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high, Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream. Ay me! I fondly dream Had ye bin there\&amp;#39;—for what could that have done? What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore, The Muse herself, for her enchanting son, Whom universal nature did lament, When by the rout that made the hideous roar His gory visage down the stream was sent, Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore? Alas! what boots it with incessant care To tend the homely, slighted shepherd\&amp;#39;s trade, And strictly meditate the thankless Muse? Were it not better done, as others use, To sport with Amaryllis in the shade, Or with the tangles of Neæra\&amp;#39;s hair? Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise (That last infirmity of noble mind) To scorn delights and live laborious days; But the fair guerdon when we hope to find, And think to burst out into sudden blaze, Comes the blind Fury with th\&amp;#39;abhorred shears, And slits the thin-spun life. &amp;quot;But not the praise,&amp;quot; Phoebus replied, and touch\&amp;#39;d my trembling ears; &amp;quot;Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil, Nor in the glistering foil Set off to th\&amp;#39;world, nor in broad rumour lies, But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes And perfect witness of all-judging Jove; As he pronounces lastly on each deed, Of so much fame in Heav\&amp;#39;n expect thy meed.&amp;quot; O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour\&amp;#39;d flood, Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown\&amp;#39;d with vocal reeds, That strain I heard was of a higher mood. But now my oat proceeds, And listens to the Herald of the Sea, That came in Neptune\&amp;#39;s plea. He ask\&amp;#39;d the waves, and ask\&amp;#39;d the felon winds, &amp;quot;What hard mishap hath doom\&amp;#39;d this gentle swain?&amp;quot; And question\&amp;#39;d every gust of rugged wings That blows from off each beaked promontory. They knew not of his story; And sage Hippotades their answer brings, That not a blast was from his dungeon stray\&amp;#39;d; The air was calm, and on the level brine Sleek Panope with all her sisters play\&amp;#39;d. It was that fatal and perfidious bark, Built in th\&amp;#39;eclipse, and rigg\&amp;#39;d with curses dark, That sunk so low that sacred head of thine. Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow, His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge, Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge Like to that sanguine flower inscrib\&amp;#39;d with woe. &amp;quot;Ah! who hath reft,&amp;quot; quoth he, &amp;quot;my dearest pledge?&amp;quot; Last came, and last did go, The Pilot of the Galilean lake; Two massy keys he bore of metals twain (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain). He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake: &amp;quot;How well could I have spar\&amp;#39;d for thee, young swain, Enow of such as for their bellies\&amp;#39; sake Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold? Of other care they little reck\&amp;#39;ning make Than how to scramble at the shearers\&amp;#39; feast And shove away the worthy bidden guest. Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold A sheep-hook, or have learn\&amp;#39;d aught else the least That to the faithful herdman\&amp;#39;s art belongs! What recks it them? What need they? They are sped; And when they list their lean and flashy songs Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw, The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed, But, swoll\&amp;#39;n with wind and the rank mist they draw, Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread; Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw Daily devours apace, and nothing said, But that two-handed engine at the door Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more&amp;quot;. Return, Alpheus: the dread voice is past That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse, And call the vales and bid them hither cast Their bells and flow\&amp;#39;rets of a thousand hues. Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks, On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks, Throw hither all your quaint enamel\&amp;#39;d eyes, That on the green turf suck the honied showers And purple all the ground with vernal flowers. Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine, The white pink, and the pansy freak\&amp;#39;d with jet, The glowing violet, The musk-rose, and the well attir\&amp;#39;d woodbine, With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head, And every flower that sad embroidery wears; Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed, And daffadillies fill their cups with tears, To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies. For so to interpose a little ease, Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise. Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding seas Wash far away, where\&amp;#39;er thy bones are hurl\&amp;#39;d; Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides, Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide Visit\&amp;#39;st the bottom of the monstrous world, Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied, Sleep\&amp;#39;st by the fable of Bellerus old, Where the great vision of the guarded mount Looks toward Namancos and Bayona\&amp;#39;s hold: Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth; And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth. Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more, For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the wat\&amp;#39;ry floor; So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed, And yet anon repairs his drooping head, And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high Through the dear might of him that walk\&amp;#39;d the waves; Where, other groves and other streams along, With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves, And hears the unexpressive nuptial song, In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love. There entertain him all the Saints above, In solemn troops, and sweet societies, That sing, and singing in their glory move, And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes. Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more: Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore, In thy large recompense, and shalt be good To all that wander in that perilous flood. Thus sang the uncouth swain to th\&amp;#39;oaks and rills, While the still morn went out with sandals gray; He touch\&amp;#39;d the tender stops of various quills, With eager thought warbling his Doric lay; And now the sun had stretch\&amp;#39;d out all the hills, And now was dropp\&amp;#39;d into the western bay; At last he rose, and twitch\&amp;#39;d his mantle blue: To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones,The labor of an age in pilèd stones,Or that his hallowed relics should be hid Under a star-ypointing pyramid? Dear son of Memory, great heir of fame, What need’st thou such weak witness of thy name?Thou in our wonder and astonishment Hast built thyself a live-long monument. For whilst to th’ shame of slow-endeavouring art, Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book Those Delphic lines with deep impression took, Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving, Dost make us marble with too much conceiving; And so sepúlchred in such pomp dost lie,That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;This is the month, and this the happy morn, Wherein the Son of Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s eternal King, Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born, Our great redemption from above did bring; For so the holy sages once did sing, That he our deadly forfeit should release, And with his Father work us a perpetual peace. That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable, And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty, Wherewith he wont at Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s high council-table, To sit the midst of Trinal Unity, He laid aside, and here with us to be, Forsook the courts of everlasting day, And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay. Say Heav&amp;#39;nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein Afford a present to the Infant God? Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain, To welcome him to this his new abode, Now while the heav&amp;#39;n, by the Sun&amp;#39;s team untrod, Hath took no print of the approaching light, And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright? See how from far upon the eastern road The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet: O run, prevent them with thy humble ode, And lay it lowly at his blessed feet; Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet, And join thy voice unto the angel quire, From out his secret altar touch&amp;#39;d with hallow&amp;#39;d fire. It was the winter wild, While the Heav&amp;#39;n-born child, All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies; Nature in awe to him Had doff&amp;#39;d her gaudy trim, With her great Master so to sympathize: It was no season then for her To wanton with the Sun, her lusty paramour. Only with speeches fair She woos the gentle air To hide her guilty front with innocent snow, And on her naked shame, Pollute with sinful blame, The saintly veil of maiden white to throw, Confounded, that her Maker&amp;#39;s eyes Should look so near upon her foul deformities. But he, her fears to cease, Sent down the meek-ey&amp;#39;d Peace: She, crown&amp;#39;d with olive green, came softly sliding Down through the turning sphere, His ready harbinger, With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing; And waving wide her myrtle wand, She strikes a universal peace through sea and land. No war or battle&amp;#39;s sound Was heard the world around; The idle spear and shield were high uphung; The hooked chariot stood Unstain&amp;#39;d with hostile blood; The trumpet spake not to the armed throng; And kings sate still with awful eye, As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by. But peaceful was the night Wherein the Prince of Light His reign of peace upon the earth began: The winds with wonder whist, Smoothly the waters kist, Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean, Who now hath quite forgot to rave, While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave. The Stars with deep amaze Stand fix&amp;#39;d in steadfast gaze, Bending one way their precious influence; And will not take their flight, For all the morning light, Or Lucifer that often warn&amp;#39;d them thence, But in their glimmering orbs did glow, Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go. And though the shady gloom Had given day her room, The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed, And hid his head for shame, As his inferior flame The new-enlighten&amp;#39;d world no more should need: He saw a greater Sun appear Than his bright throne or burning axle-tree could bear. The shepherds on the lawn, Or ere the point of dawn, Sate simply chatting in a rustic row; Full little thought they than That the mighty Pan Was kindly come to live with them below: Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep, Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep; When such music sweet Their hearts and ears did greet, As never was by mortal finger strook, Divinely warbled voice Answering the stringed noise, As all their souls in blissful rapture took: The air such pleasure loth to lose, With thousand echoes still prolongs each heav&amp;#39;nly close. Nature, that heard such sound Beneath the hollow round Of Cynthia&amp;#39;s seat, the Airy region thrilling, Now was almost won To think her part was done, And that her reign had here its last fulfilling: She knew such harmony alone Could hold all heav&amp;#39;n and earth in happier union. At last surrounds their sight A globe of circular light, That with long beams the shame-fac&amp;#39;d Night array&amp;#39;d; The helmed Cherubim And sworded Seraphim Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display&amp;#39;d, Harping in loud and solemn quire, With unexpressive notes to Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s new-born Heir. Such music (as &amp;#39;tis said) Before was never made, But when of old the sons of morning sung, While the Creator great His constellations set, And the well-balanc&amp;#39;d world on hinges hung, And cast the dark foundations deep, And bid the welt&amp;#39;ring waves their oozy channel keep. Ring out ye crystal spheres! Once bless our human ears (If ye have power to touch our senses so) And let your silver chime Move in melodious time, And let the bass of Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s deep organ blow; And with your ninefold harmony Make up full consort to th&amp;#39;angelic symphony. For if such holy song Enwrap our fancy long, Time will run back and fetch the age of gold, And speckl&amp;#39;d Vanity Will sicken soon and die, And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould; And Hell itself will pass away, And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering Day. Yea, Truth and Justice then Will down return to men, Orb&amp;#39;d in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing, Mercy will sit between, Thron&amp;#39;d in celestial sheen, With radiant feet the tissu&amp;#39;d clouds down steering; And Heav&amp;#39;n, as at some festival, Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall. But wisest Fate says no: This must not yet be so; The Babe lies yet in smiling infancy, That on the bitter cross Must redeem our loss, So both himself and us to glorify: Yet first to those ychain&amp;#39;d in sleep, The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep, With such a horrid clang As on Mount Sinai rang While the red fire and smould&amp;#39;ring clouds outbrake: The aged Earth, aghast With terror of that blast, Shall from the surface to the centre shake, When at the world&amp;#39;s last session, The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne. And then at last our bliss Full and perfect is, But now begins; for from this happy day Th&amp;#39;old Dragon under ground, In straiter limits bound, Not half so far casts his usurped sway, And, wrath to see his kingdom fail, Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail. The Oracles are dumb; No voice or hideous hum Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving. Apollo from his shrine Can no more divine, With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving. No nightly trance or breathed spell Inspires the pale-ey&amp;#39;d priest from the prophetic cell. The lonely mountains o&amp;#39;er, And the resounding shore, A voice of weeping heard and loud lament; From haunted spring, and dale Edg&amp;#39;d with poplar pale, The parting Genius is with sighing sent; With flow&amp;#39;r-inwoven tresses torn The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn. In consecrated earth, And on the holy hearth, The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint; In urns and altars round, A drear and dying sound Affrights the flamens at their service quaint; And the chill marble seems to sweat, While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat. Peor and Ba{:a}lim Forsake their temples dim, With that twice-batter&amp;#39;d god of Palestine; And mooned Ashtaroth, Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s queen and mother both, Now sits not girt with tapers&amp;#39; holy shine; The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn; In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn. And sullen Moloch, fled, Hath left in shadows dread His burning idol all of blackest hue: In vain with cymbals&amp;#39; ring They call the grisly king, In dismal dance about the furnace blue. The brutish gods of Nile as fast, Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste. Nor is Osiris seen In Memphian grove or green, Trampling the unshower&amp;#39;d grass with lowings loud; Nor can he be at rest Within his sacred chest, Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud: In vain with timbrel&amp;#39;d anthems dark The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipp&amp;#39;d ark. He feels from Juda&amp;#39;s land The dreaded Infant&amp;#39;s hand, The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn; Nor all the gods beside Longer dare abide, Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine: Our Babe, to show his Godhead true, Can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew. So when the Sun in bed, Curtain&amp;#39;d with cloudy red, Pillows his chin upon an orient wave, The flocking shadows pale Troop to th&amp;#39;infernal jail, Each fetter&amp;#39;d ghost slips to his several grave, And the yellow-skirted fays Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-lov&amp;#39;d maze. But see, the Virgin blest Hath laid her Babe to rest: Time is our tedious song should here have ending. Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s youngest-teemed star, Hath fix&amp;#39;d her polish&amp;#39;d car, Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending; And all about the courtly stable, Bright-harness&amp;#39;d Angels sit in order serviceable.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, With loss of Eden, till one greater Man Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, Sing Heav&amp;#39;nly Muse, that on the secret top Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, In the Beginning how the Heav&amp;#39;ns and Earth Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill Delight thee more, and Siloa&amp;#39;s brook that flow&amp;#39;d Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song, That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th&amp;#39; Aonian Mount, while it pursues Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime. And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer Before all Temples th&amp;#39; upright heart and pure, Instruct me, for Thou know&amp;#39;st; Thou from the first Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss And mad&amp;#39;st it pregnant: What in me is dark Illumin, what is low raise and support; That to the highth of this great Argument I may assert Eternal Providence, And justifie the wayes of God to men. Say first, for Heav&amp;#39;n hides nothing from thy view Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause Mov&amp;#39;d our Grand Parents in that happy State, Favour&amp;#39;d of Heav&amp;#39;n so highly, to fall off From thir Creator, and transgress his Will For one restraint, Lords of the World besides? Who first seduc&amp;#39;d them to that foul revolt? Th&amp;#39; infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv&amp;#39;d The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride Had cast him out from Heav&amp;#39;n, with all his Host Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring To set himself in Glory above his Peers, He trusted to have equal&amp;#39;d the most High, If he oppos&amp;#39;d; and with ambitious aim Against the Throne and Monarchy of God Rais&amp;#39;d impious War in Heav&amp;#39;n and Battel proud With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power Hurld headlong flaming from th&amp;#39; Ethereal Skie With hideous ruine and combustion down To bottomless perdition, there to dwell In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, Who durst defie th&amp;#39; Omnipotent to Arms. Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night To mortal men, he with his horrid crew Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe Confounded though immortal: But his doom Reserv&amp;#39;d him to more wrath; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes That witness&amp;#39;d huge affliction and dismay Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: At once as far as Angels kenn he views The dismal Situation waste and wilde, A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round As one great Furnace flam&amp;#39;d, yet from those flames No light, but rather darkness visible Serv&amp;#39;d onely to discover sights of woe, Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all; but torture without end Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum&amp;#39;d: Such place Eternal Justice had prepar&amp;#39;d For those rebellious, here thir prison ordained In utter darkness, and thir portion set As far remov&amp;#39;d from God and light of Heav&amp;#39;n As from the Center thrice to th&amp;#39; utmost Pole. O how unlike the place from whence they fell! There the companions of his fall, o&amp;#39;rewhelm&amp;#39;d With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, He soon discerns, and weltring by his side One next himself in power, and next in crime, Long after known in Palestine, and nam&amp;#39;d Beelzebub. To whom th&amp;#39; Arch-Enemy, And thence in Heav&amp;#39;n call&amp;#39;d Satan, with bold words Breaking the horrid silence thus began. If thou beest he; But O how fall&amp;#39;n! how chang&amp;#39;d From him, who in the happy Realms of Light Cloth&amp;#39;d with transcendent brightness didst out-shine Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league, United thoughts and counsels, equal hope And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize, Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest From what highth fall&amp;#39;n, so much the stronger prov&amp;#39;d He with his Thunder: and till then who knew The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those, Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict, do I repent or change, Though chang&amp;#39;d in outward lustre; that fixt mind And high disdain, from sence of injur&amp;#39;d merit, That with the mightiest rais&amp;#39;d me to contend, And to the fierce contention brought along Innumerable force of Spirits arm&amp;#39;d That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, His utmost power with adverse power oppos&amp;#39;d In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav&amp;#39;n, And shook his throne. What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome? That Glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee, and deifie his power, Who from the terrour of this Arm so late Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods And this Empyreal substance cannot fail, Since through experience of this great event In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc&amp;#39;t, We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal Warr Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, Who now triumphs, and in th&amp;#39; excess of joy Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav&amp;#39;n. So spake th&amp;#39; Apostate Angel, though in pain, Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: And him thus answer&amp;#39;d soon his bold Compeer. O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers, That led th&amp;#39; imbattelld Seraphim to Warr Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds Fearless, endanger&amp;#39;d Heav&amp;#39;ns perpetual King; And put to proof his high Supremacy, Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, Too well I see and rue the dire event, That with sad overthrow and foul defeat Hath lost us Heav&amp;#39;n, and all this mighty Host In horrible destruction laid thus low, As far as Gods and Heav&amp;#39;nly Essences Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains Invincible, and vigour soon returns, Though all our Glory extinct and happy state Here swallow&amp;#39;d up in endless misery. But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now Of force believe Almighty, since no less Then such could hav orepow&amp;#39;rd such force as ours) Have left us this our spirit and strength intire Strongly to suffer and support our pains, That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, Or do him mightier service as his thralls By right of Warr, what e&amp;#39;re his business be Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire, Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; What can it then avail though yet we feel Strength undiminisht, or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment? Whereto with speedy words th&amp;#39; Arch-fiend reply&amp;#39;d. Fall&amp;#39;n Cherube, to be weak is miserable Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, To do ought good never will be our task, But ever to do ill our sole delight, As being the contrary to his high will Whom we resist. If then his Providence Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, Our labour must be to pervert that end, And out of good still to find means of evil; Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb His inmost counsels from thir destind aim. But see the angry Victor hath recall&amp;#39;d His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit Back to the Gates of Heav&amp;#39;n: the Sulphurous Hail Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice Of Heav&amp;#39;n receiv&amp;#39;d us falling, and the Thunder, Wing&amp;#39;d with red Lightning and impetuous rage, Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. Let us not slip th&amp;#39; occasion, whether scorn, Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, The seat of desolation, voyd of light, Save what the glimmering of these livid flames Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves, There rest, if any rest can harbour there, And reassembling our afflicted Powers, Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, How overcome this dire Calamity, What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, If not what resolution from despare. Thus Satan to his neerest Mate With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes That sparkling blaz&amp;#39;d, his other Parts besides Prone on the Flood, extended long and large Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr&amp;#39;d on Jove, Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast Leviathan, which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th&amp;#39; Ocean stream: Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam The Pilot of some small night-founder&amp;#39;d Skiff, Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay Chain&amp;#39;d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence Had ris&amp;#39;n or heav&amp;#39;d his head, but that the will And high permission of all-ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs, That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation, while he sought Evil to others, and enrag&amp;#39;d might see How all his malice serv&amp;#39;d but to bring forth Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn On Man by him seduc&amp;#39;t, but on himself Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour&amp;#39;d. Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld In billows, leave i&amp;#39;th&amp;#39;midst a horrid Vale. Then with expanded wings he stears his flight Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land He lights, as if it were Land that ever burn&amp;#39;d With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; And such appear&amp;#39;d in hue, as when the force Of subterranean wind transports a Hill Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter&amp;#39;d side Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible And fewel&amp;#39;d entrals thence conceiving Fire, Sublim&amp;#39;d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, And leave a singed bottom all involv&amp;#39;d With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate, Both glorying to have scap&amp;#39;t the Stygian flood As Gods, and by thir own recover&amp;#39;d strength, Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat That we must change for Heav&amp;#39;n, this mournful gloom For that celestial light? Be it so, since he Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid What shall be right: fardest from him his best Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings A mind not to be chang&amp;#39;d by Place or Time. The mind is its own place, and in it self Can make a Heav&amp;#39;n of Hell, a Hell of Heav&amp;#39;n. What matter where, if I be still the same, And what I should be, all but less then he Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least We shall be free; th&amp;#39; Almighty hath not built Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav&amp;#39;n. But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, Th&amp;#39; associates and copartners of our loss Lye thus astonisht on th&amp;#39; oblivious Pool, And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy Mansion, or once more With rallied Arms to try what may be yet Regaind in Heav&amp;#39;n, or what more lost in Hell? So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub Thus answer&amp;#39;d. Leader of those Armies bright, Which but th&amp;#39; Omnipotent none could have foyld, If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge Of battel when it rag&amp;#39;d, in all assaults Thir surest signal, they will soon resume New courage and revive, though now they lye Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, As we erewhile, astounded and amaz&amp;#39;d, No wonder, fall&amp;#39;n such a pernicious highth. He scarce had ceas&amp;#39;t when the superiour Fiend Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, Behind him cast; the broad circumference Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views At Ev&amp;#39;ning from the top of Fesole, Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, He walkt with to support uneasie steps Over the burning Marle, not like those steps On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; Nathless he so endur&amp;#39;d, till on the Beach Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call&amp;#39;d His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans&amp;#39;t Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks In Vallombrosa, where th&amp;#39; Etrurian shades High overarch&amp;#39;t imbowr; or scatterd sedge Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm&amp;#39;d Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew Busirus and his Memphian Chivalry, While with perfidious hatred they pursu&amp;#39;d The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld From the safe shore thir floating Carkases And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, Under amazement of thir hideous change. He call&amp;#39;d so loud, that all the hollow Deep Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates Warriers, the Flowr of Heav&amp;#39;n, once yours, now lost, If such astonishment as this can sieze Eternal spirits; or have ye chos&amp;#39;n this place After the toyl of Battel to repose Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav&amp;#39;n? Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood With scatter&amp;#39;d Arms and Ensigns, till anon His swift pursuers from Heav&amp;#39;n Gates discern Th&amp;#39; advantage, and descending tread us down Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe. Awake, arise, or be for ever fall&amp;#39;n. They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. Nor did they not perceave the evil plight In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd Innumerable. As when the potent Rod Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day Wav&amp;#39;d round the Coast, up call&amp;#39;d a pitchy cloud Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind, That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung Like Night, and darken&amp;#39;d all the Land of Nile: So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wind under the Cope of Hell &amp;#39;Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; Till, as a signal giv&amp;#39;n, th&amp;#39; uplifted Spear Of thir great Sultan waving to direct Thir course, in even ballance down they light On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; A multitude, like which the populous North Pour&amp;#39;d never from her frozen loyns, to pass Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands. Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms Excelling human, Princely Dignities, And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; Though of thir Names in heav&amp;#39;nly Records now Be no memorial blotted out and ras&amp;#39;d By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, By falsities and lyes the greatest part Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake God thir Creator, and th&amp;#39; invisible Glory of him that made them, to transform Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn&amp;#39;d With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, And Devils to adore for Deities: Then were they known to men by various Names, And various Idols through the Heathen World. Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last, Rous&amp;#39;d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix Thir Seats long after next the Seat of God, Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador&amp;#39;d Among the Nations round, and durst abide Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron&amp;#39;d Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac&amp;#39;d Within his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines, Abominations; and with cursed things His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan&amp;#39;d, And with thir darkness durst affront his light. First Moloch, horrid King besmear&amp;#39;d with blood Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain, In Argob and in Basan, to the stream Of utmost Arnon. Not content with such Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart Of Solomon he led by fraud to build His Temple right against the Temple of God On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence And black Gehenna call&amp;#39;d, the Type of Hell. Next Chemos, th&amp;#39; obscene dread of Moabs Sons, From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines, And Eleale to th&amp;#39; Asphaltick Pool. Peor his other Name, when he entic&amp;#39;d Israel in Sittim on thir march from Nile To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg&amp;#39;d Even to that Hill of scandal, but the Grove Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate; Till good Josiah drove them hence to Hell. With these cam they, who from the bordring flood Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male, These Feminine. For Spirits when they please Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft And uncompounded is thir Essence pure, Nor ti&amp;#39;d or manacl&amp;#39;d with joynt or limb, Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose Dilated or condens&amp;#39;t, bright or obscure, Can execute thir aerie purposes, And works of love or enmity fulfill. For those the Race of Israel oft forsook Thir living strength, and unfrequented left His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down To bestial Gods; for which thir heads as low Bow&amp;#39;d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear Of despicable foes. With these in troop Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call&amp;#39;d Astarte, Queen of Heav&amp;#39;n, with crescent Horns; To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon Sidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs, In Sion also not unsung, where stood Her Temple on th&amp;#39; offensive Mountain, built By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, Beguil&amp;#39;d by fair Idolatresses, fell To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur&amp;#39;d The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, While smooth Adonis from his native Rock Ran purple to the Sea, suppos&amp;#39;d with blood Of Thammuz yearly wounded; the Love-tale Infected Sions daughters with like heat, Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch Ezekial saw, when by the Vision led His eye survay&amp;#39;d the dark Idolatries Of alienated Judah. Next came one Who mourn&amp;#39;d in earnest, when the Captive Ark Maim&amp;#39;d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, Where he fell flat, and sham&amp;#39;d his Worshipers: Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high Rear&amp;#39;d in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon And Accaron and Gaza&amp;#39;s frontier bounds. Him follow&amp;#39;d Rimmon, whose delightful Seat Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. He also against the house of God was bold: A Leper once he lost and gain&amp;#39;d a King, Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew Gods Altar to disparage and displace For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn His odious offrings, and adore the Gods Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear&amp;#39;d A crew who under Names of old Renown, Osiris, Isis, Orus and thir Train With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus&amp;#39;d Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek Thir wandring Gods Disguis&amp;#39;d in brutish forms Rather then human. Nor did Israel scape Th&amp;#39; infection when thir borrow&amp;#39;d Gold compos&amp;#39;d The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King Doubl&amp;#39;d that sin in Bethel and in Dan, Lik&amp;#39;ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass&amp;#39;d From Egypt marching, equal&amp;#39;d with one stroke Both her first born and all her bleating Gods Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood Or Altar smoak&amp;#39;d; yet who more oft then hee In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest Turns Atheist, as did Ely&amp;#39;s Sons, who fill&amp;#39;d With lust and violence the house of God. In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, And injury and outrage: And when Night Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night In Gibeah, when the hospitable door Expos&amp;#39;d a Matron to avoid worse rape. These were the prime in order and in might; The rest were long to tell, though far renown&amp;#39;d, Th&amp;#39; Ionian Gods, of Javans issue held Gods, yet confest later then Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth Thir boasted Parents; Tita\x08n Heav&amp;#39;ns first born With his enormous brood, and birthright seis&amp;#39;d By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove His own and Rhea&amp;#39;s Son like measure found; So Jove usurping reign&amp;#39;d: these first in Creet And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top Of cold Olympus rul&amp;#39;d the middle Air Thir highest Heav&amp;#39;n; or on the Delphian Cliff, Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old Fled over Adria to th&amp;#39; Hesperian Fields, And ore the Celtic roam&amp;#39;d the utmost Isles. All these and more came flocking; but with looks Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear&amp;#39;d Obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost In loss itself; which on his count&amp;#39;nance cast Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore Semblance of worth, not substance, gently rais&amp;#39;d Thir fanting courage, and dispel&amp;#39;d thir fears. Then strait commands that at the warlike sound Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim&amp;#39;d Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall: Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld Th&amp;#39; Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc&amp;#39;t Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz&amp;#39;d, Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: At which the universal Host upsent A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night. All in a moment through the gloom were seen Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air With Orient Colours waving: with them rose A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms Appear&amp;#39;d, and serried Shields in thick array Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais&amp;#39;d To hight of noblest temper Hero&amp;#39;s old Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage Deliberate valour breath&amp;#39;d, firm and unmov&amp;#39;d With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches, troubl&amp;#39;d thoughts, and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they Breathing united force with fixed thought Mov&amp;#39;d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm&amp;#39;d Thir painful steps o&amp;#39;re the burnt soyle; and now Advanc&amp;#39;t in view, they stand, a horrid Front Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise Of Warriers old with order&amp;#39;d Spear and Shield, Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief Had to impose: He through the armed Files Darts his experienc&amp;#39;t eye, and soon traverse The whole Battalion views, thir order due, Thir visages and stature as of Gods, Thir number last he summs. And now his heart Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength Glories: For never since created man, Met such imbodied force, as nam&amp;#39;d with these Could merit more then that small infantry Warr&amp;#39;d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood Of Phlegra with th&amp;#39; Heroic Race were joyn&amp;#39;d That fought at Theb&amp;#39;s and Ilium, on each side Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds In Fable or Romance of Uthers Sons Begirt with British and Armoric Knights; And all who since Baptiz&amp;#39;d or Infidel Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban, Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ&amp;#39;d Thir dread commander: he above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost All her Original brightness, nor appear&amp;#39;d Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th&amp;#39; excess Of Glory obscur&amp;#39;d; As when the Sun new ris&amp;#39;n Looks through the Horizontal misty Air Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds On half the Nations, and with fear of change Perplexes Monarch. Dark&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;d so, yet shon Above them all th&amp;#39; Arch Angel; but his face Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast Signs of remorse and passion to behold The fellows of his crime, the followers rather (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn&amp;#39;d For ever now to have thir lot in pain, Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc&amp;#39;t Of Heav&amp;#39;n, and from Eternal Splendors flung For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire Hath scath&amp;#39;d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, With singed top thir stately growth though bare Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar&amp;#39;d To speak; whereat thir doubl&amp;#39;d Ranks they bend From wing to wing, and half enclose him round With all his Peers: attention held them mute. Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn, Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last Words interwove with sighs found out thir way. O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers Matchless, but with th&amp;#39; Almighty, and that strife Was not inglorious, though th&amp;#39; event was dire, As this place testifies, and this dire change Hateful to utter: but what power of mind Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth Of knowledge past or present, could have fear&amp;#39;d, How such united force of Gods, how such As stood like these, could ever know repulse? For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, That all these puissant Legions, whose exile Hath emptied Heav&amp;#39;n, shall fail to re-ascend Self-rais&amp;#39;d, and repossess thir native seat? For mee be witness all the Host of Heav&amp;#39;n, If counsels different, or danger shun&amp;#39;d By mee, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns Monarch in Heav&amp;#39;n, till then as one secure Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, Consent or custome, and his Regal State Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal&amp;#39;d, Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. Henceforth his might we know, and know our own So as not either to provoke, or dread New warr, provok&amp;#39;t; our better part remains To work in close design, by fraud or guile What force effected not: that he no less At length from us may find, who overcomes By force, hath overcome but half his foe. Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife There went a fame in Heav&amp;#39;n that he ere long Intended to create, and therein plant A generation, whom his choice regard Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: For this Infernal Pit shall never hold Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th&amp;#39; Abyss Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr Open or understood must be resolv&amp;#39;d. He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze Far round illumin&amp;#39;d hell: highly they rag&amp;#39;d Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped Arms Clash&amp;#39;d on thir sounding Shields the din of war, Hurling defiance toward the Vault of Heav&amp;#39;n. There stood a hill not far whose griesly top Belch&amp;#39;d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, The work of Sulphur. Thither wing&amp;#39;d with speed A numerous Brigad hasten&amp;#39;d. As when Bands Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax arm&amp;#39;d Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on, Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell From heav&amp;#39;n, for ev&amp;#39;n in heav&amp;#39;n his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of Heav&amp;#39;ns pavement, trod&amp;#39;n Gold, Then aught divine or holy else enjoy&amp;#39;d In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught Ransack&amp;#39;d the Center, and with impious hands Rifl&amp;#39;d the bowels of thir mother Earth For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew Op&amp;#39;nd into the Hill a spacious wound And dig&amp;#39;d out ribs of Gold. Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best Deserve the precious bane. And here let those Who boast in mortal things, and wond&amp;#39;ring tell Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, And Strength and Art are easily out-done By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour What in an age they with incessant toyle And hands innumerable scarce perform. Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar&amp;#39;d That underneath had veins of liquid fire Sluc&amp;#39;d from the Lake, a second multitude With wond&amp;#39;rous Art found out the massie Ore, Severing each kind, and scum&amp;#39;d the Bullion dross: A third as soon had form&amp;#39;d within the ground A various mould, and from the boyling cells By strange conveyance fill&amp;#39;d each hollow nook, As in an Organ from one blast of wind To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid With Golden Architrave; nor did there want Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav&amp;#39;n, The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon, Nor great Alcairo such magnificence Equal&amp;#39;d in all thir glories, to inshrine Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove In wealth and luxurie. Th&amp;#39; ascending pile Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores Op&amp;#39;ning thir brazen foulds discover wide Within, her ample spaces, o&amp;#39;re the smooth And level pavement: from the arched roof Pendant by suttle Magic many a row Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light As from a sky. The hasty multitude Admiring enter&amp;#39;d, and the work some praise And some the Architect: his hand was known In Heav&amp;#39;n by many a Towred structure high, Where Scepter&amp;#39;d Angels held thir residence, And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, Each in his Hierarchie, the Orders bright. Nor was his name unheard or unador&amp;#39;d In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land Men call&amp;#39;d him Mulciber; and how he fell From Heav&amp;#39;n, they fabl&amp;#39;d, thrown by angry Jove Sheer o&amp;#39;re the Chrystal Battlements; from Morn To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, A Summers day; and with the setting Sun Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, On Lemnos th&amp;#39; Aegaean Ile: thus they relate, Erring; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before; nor aught avail&amp;#39;d him now To have built in Heav&amp;#39;n high Towrs; nor did he scape By all his Engins, but was headlong sent With his industrious crew to build in hell. Mean while the winged Haralds by command Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim A solemn Councel forthwith to be held At Pandaemonium, the high Capital Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call&amp;#39;d From every Band and squared Regiment By place or choice the worthiest; they anon With hunderds and with thousands trooping came Attended: all access was throng&amp;#39;d, the Gates And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall (Though like a cover&amp;#39;d field, where Champions bold Wont ride in arm&amp;#39;d, and at the Soldans chair Defi&amp;#39;d the best of Panim chivalry To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) Thick swarm&amp;#39;d, both on the ground and in the air, Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, Pour forth thir populous youth about the Hive In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, New rub&amp;#39;d with Baum, expatiate and confer Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd Swarm&amp;#39;d and were straitn&amp;#39;d; till the Signal giv&amp;#39;n Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves, Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees, Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth and dance Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms Reduc&amp;#39;d thir shapes immense, and were at large, Though without number still amidst the Hall Of that infernal Court. But far within And in thir own dimensions like themselves The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat&amp;#39;s, Frequent and full. After short silence then And summons read, the great consult began.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;MEanwhile the hainous and despightfull act Of Satan done in Paradise, and how Hee in the Serpent, had perverted Eve, Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, Was known in Heav&amp;#39;n; for what can scape the Eye Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart Omniscient, who in all things wise and just, Hinder&amp;#39;d not Satan to attempt the minde Of Man, with strength entire, and free will arm&amp;#39;d, Complete to have discover&amp;#39;d and repulst Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend. For still they knew, and ought to have still remember&amp;#39;d The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, Incurr&amp;#39;d, what could they less, the penaltie, And manifold in sin, deserv&amp;#39;d to fall. Up into Heav&amp;#39;n from Paradise in haste Th&amp;#39; Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad For Man, for of his state by this they knew, Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln Entrance unseen. Soon as th&amp;#39; unwelcome news From Earth arriv&amp;#39;d at Heaven Gate, displeas&amp;#39;d All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare That time Celestial visages, yet mixt With pitie, violated not thir bliss. About the new-arriv&amp;#39;d, in multitudes Th&amp;#39; ethereal People ran, to hear and know How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream Accountable made haste to make appear With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, And easily approv&amp;#39;d; when the most High Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, Amidst in Thunder utter&amp;#39;d thus his voice. Assembl&amp;#39;d Angels, and ye Powers return&amp;#39;d From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, Nor troubl&amp;#39;d at these tidings from the Earth, Which your sincerest care could not prevent, Foretold so lately what would come to pass, When first this Tempter cross&amp;#39;d the Gulf from Hell. I told ye then he should prevail and speed On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc&amp;#39;t And flatter&amp;#39;d out of all, believing lies Against his Maker; no Decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his Fall, Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free Will, to her own inclining left In eevn scale. But fall&amp;#39;n he is, and now What rests but that the mortal Sentence pass On his transgression, Death denounc&amp;#39;t that day, Which he presumes already vain and void, Because not yet inflicted, as he fear&amp;#39;d, By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. Justice shall not return as bountie scorn&amp;#39;d. But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr&amp;#39;d All Judgement, whether in Heav&amp;#39;n, or Earth, or Hell. Easie it might be seen that I intend Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design&amp;#39;d Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, And destin&amp;#39;d Man himself to judge Man fall&amp;#39;n. So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son Blaz&amp;#39;d forth unclouded Deitie; he full Resplendent all his Father manifest Express&amp;#39;d, and thus divinely answer&amp;#39;d milde. Father Eternal, thine is to decree, Mine both in Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth to do thy will Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov&amp;#39;d Mayst ever rest well pleas&amp;#39;d. I go to judge On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, Whoever judg&amp;#39;d, the worst on mee must light, When time shall be, for so I undertook Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom On me deriv&amp;#39;d, yet I shall temper so Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none Are to behold the Judgment, but the judg&amp;#39;d, Those two; the third best absent is condemn&amp;#39;d, Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers, Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay. Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing&amp;#39;d. Now was the Sun in Western cadence low From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour To fan the Earth now wak&amp;#39;d, and usher in The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes Brought to thir Ears, while day declin&amp;#39;d, they heard, And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God Approaching, thus to Adam call&amp;#39;d aloud. Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, Not pleas&amp;#39;d, thus entertaind with solitude, Where obvious dutie erewhile appear&amp;#39;d unsaught: Or come I less conspicuous, or what change Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first To offend, discount&amp;#39;nanc&amp;#39;t both, and discompos&amp;#39;d; Love was not in thir looks, either to God Or to each other, but apparent guilt, And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer&amp;#39;d brief. I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom The gracious judge without revile repli&amp;#39;d. My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear&amp;#39;d, But still rejoyc&amp;#39;t, how is it now become So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? To whom thus Adam sore beset repli&amp;#39;d. O Heav&amp;#39;n! in evil strait this day I stand Before my judge, either to undergoe My self the total Crime, or to accuse My other self, the partner of my life; Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, I should conceal, and not expose to blame By my complaint; but strict necessitie Subdues me, and calamitous constraint Least on my head both sin and punishment, However insupportable, be all Devolv&amp;#39;d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. This Woman whom thou mad&amp;#39;st to be my help, And gav&amp;#39;st me as thy perfet gift, so good, So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, That from her hand I could suspect no ill, And what she did, whatever in it self, Her doing seem&amp;#39;d to justifie the deed; Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. To whom the sovran Presence thus repli&amp;#39;d. Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, Superior, or but equal, that to her Thou did&amp;#39;st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, And for thee, whose perfection farr excell&amp;#39;d Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd Shee was indeed, and lovely to attract Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts Were such as under Government well seem&amp;#39;d, Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part And person, had&amp;#39;st thou known thy self aright. So having said, he thus to Eve in few: Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm&amp;#39;d, Confessing soon, yet not before her judge Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli&amp;#39;d. The Serpent me beguil&amp;#39;d and I did eate. Which when the Lord God heard, without delay To Judgement he proceeded on th&amp;#39; accus&amp;#39;d Serpent though brute, unable to transferre The Guilt on him who made him instrument Of mischief, and polluted from the end Of his Creation; justly then accurst, As vitiated in Nature: more to know Concern&amp;#39;d not Man (since he no further knew) Nor alter&amp;#39;d his offence; yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom apply&amp;#39;d, Though in mysterious terms, judg&amp;#39;d as then best: And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field; Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, And dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy Life. Between Thee and the Woman I will put Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; Her Seed shall bruse thy head, thou bruise his heel. So spake this Oracle, then verifi&amp;#39;d When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav&amp;#39;n, Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht In open shew, and with ascention bright Captivity led captive through the Aire, The Realm it self of Satan long usurpt, Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; Eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn&amp;#39;d. Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc&amp;#39;d. Because thou hast heark&amp;#39;nd to the voice of thy Wife, And eaten of the Tree concerning which I charg&amp;#39;d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, Curs&amp;#39;d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth Unbid, and thou shalt eate th&amp;#39; Herb of th&amp;#39; Field, In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread, Till thou return unto the ground, for thou Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. So judg&amp;#39;d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, And th&amp;#39; instant stroke of Death denounc&amp;#39;t that day Remov&amp;#39;d farr off; then pittying how they stood Before him naked to the aire, that now Must suffer change, disdain&amp;#39;d not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume, As when he wash&amp;#39;d his servants feet so now As Father of his Familie he clad Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, Araying cover&amp;#39;d from his Fathers sight. To him with swift ascent he up returnd, Into his blissful bosom reassum&amp;#39;d In glory as of old, to him appeas&amp;#39;d All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. Meanwhile ere thus was sin&amp;#39;d and judg&amp;#39;d on Earth, Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, In counterview within the Gates, that now Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass&amp;#39;d through, Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. O Son, why sit we here each other viewing Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides For us his ofspring deare; It cannot be But that success attends him; if mishap, Ere this he had return&amp;#39;d, with fury driv&amp;#39;n By his Avenger, since no place like this Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, Wings growing, and Dominion giv&amp;#39;n me large Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, Or sympathie, or som connatural force Powerful at greatest distance to unite With secret amity things of like kinde By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade Inseparable must with mee along: For Death from Sin no power can separate. But least the difficultie of passing back Stay his return perhaps over this Gulfe Impassable, Impervious, let us try Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine Not unagreeable, to found a path Over this Maine from Hell to that new World Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument Of merit high to all th&amp;#39; infernal Host, Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn By this new felt attraction and instinct. Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. Goe whither Fate and inclination strong Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste The savour of Death from all things there that live: Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. So saying, with delight he snuff&amp;#39;d the smell Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, Against the day of Battel, to a Field, Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur&amp;#39;d With sent of living Carcasses design&amp;#39;d For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. So sented the grim Feature, and upturn&amp;#39;d His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, Sagacious of his Quarry from so farr. Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark Flew divers, and with Power (thir Power was great) Hovering upon the Waters; what they met Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea Tost up and down, together crowded drove From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive Mountains of Ice, that stop th&amp;#39; imagin&amp;#39;d way Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, As with a Trident smote, and fix&amp;#39;t as firm As Delos floating once; the rest his look Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather&amp;#39;d beach They fasten&amp;#39;d, and the Mole immense wraught on Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall Immovable of this now fenceless world Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. So, if great things to small may be compar&amp;#39;d, Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, From Susa his Memnonian Palace high Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn&amp;#39;d, And scourg&amp;#39;d with many a stroak th&amp;#39; indignant waves. Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock Over the vext Abyss, following the track Of Satan, to the self same place where hee First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe From out of Chaos to the out side bare Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made And durable; and now in little space The confines met of Empyrean Heav&amp;#39;n And of this World, and on the left hand Hell With long reach interpos&amp;#39;d; three sev&amp;#39;ral wayes In sight, to each of these three places led. And now thir way to Earth they had descri&amp;#39;d, To Paradise first tending, when behold Satan in likeness of an Angel bright Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: Disguis&amp;#39;d he came, but those his Children dear Thir Parent soon discern&amp;#39;d, though in disguise. Hee after Eve seduc&amp;#39;t, unminded slunk Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought Vain covertures; but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them terrifi&amp;#39;d Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth Might suddenly inflict; that past, return&amp;#39;d By Night, and listening where the hapless Paire Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood Not instant, but of future time. With joy And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return&amp;#39;d, And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop&amp;#39;t Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas&amp;#39;d. Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, Thy Trophies, which thou view&amp;#39;st as not thine own, Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: For I no sooner in my Heart divin&amp;#39;d, My Heart, which by a secret harmonie Still moves with thine, join&amp;#39;d in connexion sweet, That thou on Earth hadst prosper&amp;#39;d, which thy looks Now also evidence, but straight I felt Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt That I must after thee with this thy Son; Such fatal consequence unites us three: Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure Detain from following thy illustrious track. Thou hast atchiev&amp;#39;d our libertie, confin&amp;#39;d Within Hell Gates till, now, thou us impow&amp;#39;rd To fortifie thus farr, and overlay With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain&amp;#39;d With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng&amp;#39;d Our foile in Heav&amp;#39;n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, As Battel hath adjudg&amp;#39;d, from this new World Retiring, by his own doom alienated, And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide Of all things parted by th&amp;#39; Empyreal bounds, His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, Or trie thee now more dang&amp;#39;rous to his Throne. Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, High proof ye now have giv&amp;#39;n to be the Race Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, Antagonist of Heav&amp;#39;ns Almightie King) Amply have merited of me, of all Th&amp;#39; infernal Empire, that so neer Heav&amp;#39;ns dore Triumphal with triumphal act have met, Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease To my associate Powers, them to acquaint With these successes, and with them rejoyce, You two this way, among these numerous Orbs All yours, right down to Paradise descend; There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth Dominion exercise and in the Aire, Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar&amp;#39;d, Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. My Substitutes I send ye, and Create Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, Through Sin to Death expos&amp;#39;d by my exploit. If your joynt power prevailes, th&amp;#39; affaires of Hell No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. So saying he dismiss&amp;#39;d them, they with speed Thir course through thickest Constellations held Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips Then sufferd. Th&amp;#39; other way Satan went down The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, That scorn&amp;#39;d his indignation: through the Gate, Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass&amp;#39;d, And all about found desolate; for those Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, Flown to the upper World; the rest were all Farr to the inland retir&amp;#39;d, about the walls Of Pandaemonium, Citie and proud seate Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand In Council sate, sollicitous what chance Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee Departing gave command, and they observ&amp;#39;d. As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond The Realm of Aladule, in his retreate To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late Heav&amp;#39;n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell Many a dark League, reduc&amp;#39;t in careful Watch Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer from the search Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, In shew Plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order, past; and from the dore Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible Ascended his high Throne, which under state Of richest texture spred, at th&amp;#39; upper end Was plac&amp;#39;t in regal lustre. Down a while He sate, and round about him saw unseen: At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head And shape Starr bright appeer&amp;#39;d, or brighter, clad With what permissive glory since his fall Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz&amp;#39;d At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish&amp;#39;d beheld, Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th&amp;#39; acclaime: Forth rush&amp;#39;d in haste the great consulting Peers, Rais&amp;#39;d from thir Dark Divan, and with like joy Congratulant approach&amp;#39;d him, who with hand Silence, and with these words attention won. Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, For in possession such, not onely of right, I call ye and declare ye now, returnd Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth Triumphant out of this infernal Pit Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven Little inferiour, by my adventure hard With peril great atchiev&amp;#39;d. Long were to tell What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine Voyag&amp;#39;d th&amp;#39; unreal, vast, unbounded deep Of horrible confusion, over which By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav&amp;#39;d To expedite your glorious march; but I Toild out my uncouth passage, forc&amp;#39;t to ride Th&amp;#39; untractable Abysse, plung&amp;#39;d in the womb Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos&amp;#39;d My journey strange, with clamorous uproare Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found The new created World, which fame in Heav&amp;#39;n Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful Of absolute perfection, therein Man Plac&amp;#39;t in a Paradise, by our exile Made happie; Him by fraud I have seduc&amp;#39;d From his Creator, and the more to increase Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv&amp;#39;n up Both his beloved Man and all his World, To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, Without our hazard, labour, or allarme, To range in, and to dwell, and over Man To rule, as over all he should have rul&amp;#39;d. True is, mee also he hath judg&amp;#39;d, or rather Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape Man I deceav&amp;#39;d: that which to mee belongs, Is enmity, which he will put between Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: A World who would not purchase with a bruise, Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th&amp;#39; account Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods, But up and enter now into full bliss. So having said, a while he stood, expecting Thir universal shout and high applause To fill his eare, when contrary he hears On all sides, from innumerable tongues A dismal universal hiss, the sound Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining Each other, till supplanted down he fell A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power Now rul&amp;#39;d him, punisht in the shape he sin&amp;#39;d, According to his doom: he would have spoke, But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue To forked tongue, for now were all transform&amp;#39;d Alike, to Serpents all as accessories To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now With complicated monsters head and taile, Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, And Dipsas (not so thick swarm&amp;#39;d once the Soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem&amp;#39;d Above the rest still to retain; they all Him follow&amp;#39;d issuing forth to th&amp;#39; open Field, Where all yet left of that revolted Rout Heav&amp;#39;n-fall&amp;#39;n, in station stood or just array, Sublime with expectation when to see ln Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, And the dire hiss renew&amp;#39;d, and the dire form Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, As in thir crime. Thus was th&amp;#39; applause they meant, Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, His will who reigns above, to aggravate Thir penance, laden with Fruit like that Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve Us&amp;#39;d by the Tempter: on that prospect strange Thir earnest eyes they fix&amp;#39;d, imagining For one forbidden Tree a multitude Now ris&amp;#39;n, to work them furder woe or shame; Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck&amp;#39;d The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam&amp;#39;d; This more delusive, not the touch, but taste Deceav&amp;#39;d; they fondly thinking to allay Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit Chewd bitter Ashes, which th&amp;#39; offended taste With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, With hatefullest disrelish writh&amp;#39;d thir jaws With soot and cinders fill&amp;#39;d; so oft they fell Into the same illusion, not as Man Whom they triumph&amp;#39;d once lapst. Thus were they plagu&amp;#39;d And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum&amp;#39;d, Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo This annual humbling certain number&amp;#39;d days, To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc&amp;#39;t. However some tradition they dispers&amp;#39;d Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, And Fabl&amp;#39;d how the Serpent, whom they calld Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv&amp;#39;n And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair Too soon arriv&amp;#39;d, Sin there in power before, Once actual, now in body, and to dwell Habitual habitant; behind her Death Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd With travail difficult, not better farr Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, Unnam&amp;#39;d, undreaded, and thy self half starv&amp;#39;d? Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, There best, where most with ravin I may meet; Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. To whom th&amp;#39; incestuous Mother thus repli&amp;#39;d. Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, and Flours Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, No homely morsels, and whatever thing The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar&amp;#39;d, Till I in Man residing through the Race, His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, And season him thy last and sweetest prey. This said, they both betook them several wayes, Both to destroy, or unimmortal make All kinds, and for destruction to mature Sooner or later; which th&amp;#39; Almightie seeing, From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance To waste and havoc yonder World, which I So fair and good created, and had still Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man Let in these wastful Furies, who impute Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell And his Adherents, that with so much ease I suffer them to enter and possess A place so heav&amp;#39;nly, and conniving-seem To gratifie my scornful Enemies, That laugh, as if transported with some fit Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, At random yielded up to their misrule; And know not that I call&amp;#39;d and drew them thither My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed On what was pure, till cramm&amp;#39;d and gorg&amp;#39;d, nigh burst With suckt and glutted offal, at one sling Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. Then Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth renewd shall be made pure To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: Till then the Curse pronounc&amp;#39;t on both precedes. He ended, and the heav&amp;#39;nly Audience loud Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, Destin&amp;#39;d restorer of Mankind, by whom New Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, Or down from Heav&amp;#39;n descend. Such was thir song, While the Creator calling forth by name His mightie Angels gave them several charge, As sorted best with present things. The Sun Had first his precept so to move, so shine, As might affect the Earth with cold and heat Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone Her office they prescrib&amp;#39;d, to th&amp;#39; other five Thir planetarie motions and aspects In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt Thir influence malignant when to showre, Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set Thir corners, when with bluster to confound Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more From the Suns Axle; they with labour push&amp;#39;d Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun Was bid turn Reines from th&amp;#39; Equinoctial Rode Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav&amp;#39;n Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring Perpetual smil&amp;#39;d on Earth with vernant Flours, Equal in Days and Nights, except to those Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun To recompence his distance, in thir sight Had rounded still th&amp;#39; Horizon, and not known Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow From cold Estotiland, and South as farr Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn&amp;#39;d His course intended; else how had the World Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? These changes in the Heav&amp;#39;ns, though slow, produc&amp;#39;d Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; With adverse blast upturns them from the South Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, Sirocco, and Libecchio, Thus began Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first Daughter of Sin, among th&amp;#39; irrational, Death introduc&amp;#39;d through fierce antipathie: Beast now with Beast gan war, and Fowle with Fowle, And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe Of Man, but fled him, or with count&amp;#39;nance grim Glar&amp;#39;d on him passing: these were from without The growing miseries, which Adam saw Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, And in a troubl&amp;#39;d Sea of passion tost, Thus to disburd&amp;#39;n sought with sad complaint. O miserable of happie! is this the end Of this new glorious World, and mee so late The Glory of that Glory, who now becom Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face Of God, whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness: yet well, if here would end The miserie, I deserv&amp;#39;d it, and would beare My own deservings; but this will not serve; All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, Is propagated curse. O voice once heard Delightfully, Encrease and multiply, Now death to heare! for what can I encrease Or multiplie, but curses on my head? Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling The evil on him brought by me, will curse My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks Shall be the execration; so besides Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, On mee as on thir natural center light Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee From darkness to promote me, or here place In this delicious Garden? as my Will Concurd not to my being, it were but right And equal to reduce me to my dust, Desirous to resigne, and render back All I receav&amp;#39;d, unable to performe Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold The good I sought not. To the loss of that, Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added The sense of endless woes? inexplicable Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, I thus contest; then should have been refusd Those terms whatever, when they were propos&amp;#39;d: Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, Then cavil the conditions? and though God Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son Prove disobedient, and reprov&amp;#39;d, retort, Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, But Natural necessity begot. God made thee of choice his own, and of his own To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: O welcom hour whenever! why delayes His hand to execute what his Decree Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, Why am I mockt with death, and length&amp;#39;nd out To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth Insensible, how glad would lay me down As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse To mee and to my ofspring would torment me With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man Which God inspir&amp;#39;d, cannot together perish With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, Or in some other dismal place who knows But I shall die a living Death? O thought Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath Of Life that sinn&amp;#39;d; what dies but what had life And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. All of me then shall die: let this appease The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. For though the Lord of all be infinite, Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, But mortal doom&amp;#39;d. How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? Can he make deathless Death? that were to make Strange contradiction, which to God himself Impossible is held, as Argument Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, For angers sake, finite to infinite In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour Satisfi&amp;#39;d never; that were to extend His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, By which all Causes else according still To the reception of thir matter act, Not to th&amp;#39; extent of thir own Spheare. But say That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos&amp;#39;d, Bereaving sense, but endless miserie From this day onward, which 1 feel begun Both in me, and without me, and so last To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution On my defensless head; both Death and I Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, Nor I on my part single, in mee all Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! So disinherited how would ye bless Me now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn&amp;#39;d, If guiltless? But from me what can proceed, But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav&amp;#39;d, Not to do onely, but to will the same With me? how can they then acquitted stand In sight of God? Him after all Disputes Forc&amp;#39;t I absolve: all my evasions vain, And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still But to my own conviction: first and last On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; So might the wrauth. Fond wish! couldst thou support That burden heavier then the Earth to bear Then all the World much heavier, though divided With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir&amp;#39;st And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future, To Satan only like both crime and doom. O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears And horrors hast thou driv&amp;#39;n me; out of which I find no way, from deep to deeper plung&amp;#39;d! Thus Adam to himself lamented loud Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell, Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, Which to his evil Conscience represented All things with double terror: On the Ground Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft Curs&amp;#39;d his Creation, Death as oft accus&amp;#39;d Of tardie execution, since denounc&amp;#39;t The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, Justice Divine not hast&amp;#39;n to be just? But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, With other echo late I taught your Shades To answer, and resound farr other Song. Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve bebeld, Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, Soft words to his fierce passion she assay&amp;#39;d: But her with stern regard he thus repell&amp;#39;d. Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best Befits thee with him leagu&amp;#39;d, thy self as false And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee Henceforth; least that too heav&amp;#39;nly form, pretended To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee I had persisted happie, had not thy pride And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, Rejected my forewarning, and disdain&amp;#39;d Not to be trusted, longing to be seen Though by the Devil himself, him overweening To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting Fool&amp;#39;d and beguil&amp;#39;d, by him thou, I by thee, To trust thee from my side, imagin&amp;#39;d wise, Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, And understood not all was but a shew Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, More to the part sinister from me drawn, Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie To my just number found. O why did God, Creator wise, that peopl&amp;#39;d highest Heav&amp;#39;n With Spirits Masculine, create at last This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect Of Nature, and not fill the World at once With Men as Angels without Feminine, Or find some other way to generate Mankind? this mischief had not then befall&amp;#39;n, And more that shall befall, innumerable Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either He never shall find out fit Mate, but such As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain Through her perversness, but shall see her gaind By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld By Parents, or his happiest choice too late Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: Which infinite calamitie shall cause To Humane life, and houshold peace confound. He added not, and from her turn&amp;#39;d, but Eve Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas&amp;#39;d not flowing, And tresses all disorderd, at his feet Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav&amp;#39;n What love sincere, and reverence in my heart I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, Unhappilie deceav&amp;#39;d; thy suppliant I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, As joyn&amp;#39;d in injuries, one enmitie Against a Foe by doom express assign&amp;#39;d us, That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not Thy hatred for this miserie befall&amp;#39;n, On me alreadie lost, mee then thy self More miserable; both have sin&amp;#39;d, but thou Against God onely, I against God and thee, And to the place of judgment will return, There with my cries importune Heaven, that all The sentence from thy head remov&amp;#39;d may light On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, Mee mee onely just object of his ire. She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, Immoveable till peace obtain&amp;#39;d from fault Acknowledg&amp;#39;d and deplor&amp;#39;d, in Adam wraught Commiseration; soon his heart relented Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, Now at his feet submissive in distress, Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, His counsel whom she had displeas&amp;#39;d, his aide; As one disarm&amp;#39;d, his anger all he lost, And thus with peaceful words uprais&amp;#39;d her soon. Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, So now of what thou knowst not, who desir&amp;#39;st The punishment all on thy self; alas, Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers Could alter high Decrees, I to that place Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, That on my head all might be visited, Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv&amp;#39;n, To me committed and by me expos&amp;#39;d. But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame Each other, blam&amp;#39;d enough elsewhere, but strive In offices of Love, how we may light&amp;#39;n Each others burden in our share of woe; Since this days Death denounc&amp;#39;t, if ought I see, Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac&amp;#39;t evill, A long days dying to augment our paine, And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv&amp;#39;d. To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli&amp;#39;d. Adam, by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can finde, Found so erroneous, thence by just event Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, Restor&amp;#39;d by thee, vile as I am, to place Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart Living or dying, from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris&amp;#39;n, Tending to some relief of our extremes, Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, As in our evils, and of easier choice. If care of our descent perplex us most, Which must be born to certain woe, devourd By Death at last, and miserable it is To be to others cause of misery, Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring Into this cursed World a woful Race, That after wretched Life must be at last Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. Childless thou art, Childless remaine: so Death Shall be deceav&amp;#39;d his glut, and with us two Be forc&amp;#39;d to satisfie his Rav&amp;#39;nous Maw. But if thou judge it hard and difficult, Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain From Loves due Rites, Nuptial imbraces sweet, And with desire to languish without hope, Before the present object languishing With like desire, which would be meserie And torment less then none of what we dread, Then both our selves and Seed at once to free From what we fear for both, let us make short, Let us seek Death, or he not found, supply With our own hands his Office on our selves; Why stand we longer shivering under feares, That shew no end but Death, and have the power, Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, Destruction with destruction to destroy. She ended heer, or vehement despaire Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts Had entertaind, as di&amp;#39;d her Cheeks with pale. But Adam with such counsel nothing sway&amp;#39;d, To better hopes his more attentive minde Labouring had rais&amp;#39;d, and thus to Eve repli&amp;#39;d. Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems To argue in thee somthing more sublime And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes That excellence thought in thee, and implies, Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret For loss of life and pleasure overlov&amp;#39;d. Or if thou covet death, as utmost end Of miserie, so thinking to evade The penaltie pronounc&amp;#39;t, doubt not but God Hath wiselier arm&amp;#39;d his vengeful ire then so To be forestall&amp;#39;d; much more I fear least Death So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine We are by doom to pay; rather such acts Of contumacie will provoke the highest To make death in us live: Then let us seek Some safer resolution, which methinks I have in view, calling to minde with heed Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv&amp;#39;d Against us this deceit: to crush his head Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost By death brought on our selves, or childless days Resolv&amp;#39;d, as thou proposest; so our Foe Shall scape his punishment ordain&amp;#39;d, and wee Instead shall double ours upon our heads. No more be mention&amp;#39;d then of violence Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, Reluctance against God and his just yoke Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard and judg&amp;#39;d Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected Immediate dissolution, which we thought Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, And bringing forth, soon recompenc&amp;#39;t with joy, Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope Glanc&amp;#39;d on the ground, with labour I must earne My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; My labour will sustain me; and least Cold Or Heat should injure us, his timely care Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands Cloath&amp;#39;d us unworthie, pitying while he judg&amp;#39;d; How much more, if we pray him, will his ear Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, And teach us further by what means to shun Th&amp;#39; inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, Which now the Skie with various Face begins To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish Our Limbs benumm&amp;#39;d, ere this diurnal Starr Leave cold the Night, how we his gather&amp;#39;d beams Reflected, may with matter sere foment, Or by collision of two bodies grinde The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv&amp;#39;n down Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, And sends a comfortable heat from farr, Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, And what may else be remedie or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace Beseeching him, so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life, sustain&amp;#39;d By him with many comforts, till we end In dust, our final rest and native home. What better can we do, then to the place Repairing where he judg&amp;#39;d us, prostrate fall Before him reverent, and there confess Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign&amp;#39;d, and humiliation meek. Undoubtedly he will relent and turn From his displeasure; in whose look serene, When angry most he seem&amp;#39;d and most severe, What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place Repairing where he judg&amp;#39;d them prostrate fell Before him reverent, and both confess&amp;#39;d Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg&amp;#39;d, with tears Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign&amp;#39;d, and humiliation meek.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;THus they in lowliest plight repentant stood Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above Prevenient Grace descending had remov&amp;#39;d The stonie from thir hearts, &amp;amp; made new flesh Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breath&amp;#39;d Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer Inspir&amp;#39;d, and wing&amp;#39;d for Heav&amp;#39;n with speedier flight Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port Not of mean suiters, nor important less Seem&amp;#39;d thir Petition, then when th&amp;#39; ancient Pair In Fables old, less ancient yet then these, Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine Of Themis stood devout. To Heav&amp;#39;n thir prayers Flew up, nor missd the way, by envious windes Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passd Dimentionless through Heav&amp;#39;nly dores; then clad With incense, where the Golden Altar fum&amp;#39;d, By thir great Intercessor, came in sight Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son Presenting, thus to intercede began. See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring, Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed Sow&amp;#39;n with contrition in his heart, then those Which his own hand manuring all the Trees Of Paradise could have produc&amp;#39;t, ere fall&amp;#39;n From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare To supplication, heare his sighs though mute; Unskilful with what words to pray, Iet mee Interpret for him, mee his Advocate And propitiation, all his works on mee Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay. Accept me, and in mee from these receave The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live Before thee reconcil&amp;#39;d, at least his days Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse) To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss, Made one with me as I with thee am one. To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene. All thy request for Man, accepted Son, Obtain, all thy request was my Decree: But longer in that Paradise to dwell, The Law I gave to Nature him forbids: Those pure immortal Elements that know No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule, Eject him tainted now, and purge him off As a distemper, gross to aire as gross, And mortal food, as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts Created him endowd, with Happiness And Immortalitie: that fondly lost, This other serv&amp;#39;d but to eternize woe; Till I provided Death; so Death becomes His final remedie, and after Life Tri&amp;#39;d in sharp tribulation, and refin&amp;#39;d By Faith and faithful works, to second Life, Wak&amp;#39;t in the renovation of the just, Resignes him up with Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth renewd. But let us call to Synod all the Blest Through Heav&amp;#39;ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed, As how with peccant Angels late they saw; And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. He ended, and the Son gave signal high To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps When God descended, and perhaps once more To sound at general Doom. Th&amp;#39; Angelic blast Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring, By the waters of Life, where ere they sate In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light Hasted, resorting to the Summons high, And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream Th&amp;#39; Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran Will. O Sons, like one of us Man is become To know both Good and Evil, since his taste Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got, Happier, had it suffic&amp;#39;d him to have known Good by it self, and Evil not at all. He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, My motions in him, longer then they move, His heart I know, how variable and vain Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, And live for ever, dream at least to live For ever, to remove him I decree, And send him from the Garden forth to Till The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. Michael, this my behest have thou in charge, Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend Or in behalf of Man, or to invade Vacant possession som new trouble raise: Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, From hallowd ground th&amp;#39; unholie, and denounce To them and to thir Progenie from thence Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint At the sad Sentence rigorously urg&amp;#39;d, For I behold them softn&amp;#39;d and with tears Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. If patiently thy bidding they obey, Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale To Adam what shall come in future dayes, As I shall thee enlighten, intermix My Cov&amp;#39;nant in the womans seed renewd; So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: And on the East side of the Garden place, Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes, Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, And guard all passage to the Tree of Life: Least Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey, With whose stol&amp;#39;n Fruit Man once more to delude. He ceas&amp;#39;d; and th&amp;#39; Archangelic Power prepar&amp;#39;d For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape Spangl&amp;#39;d with eyes more numerous then those Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze, Charm&amp;#39;d with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Mean while To resalute the World with sacred Light Leucothea wak&amp;#39;d, and with fresh dews imbalmd The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve Had ended now thir Orisons, and found Strength added from above, new hope to spring Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd. Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all The good which we enjoy, from Heav&amp;#39;n descends; But that from us ought should ascend to Heav&amp;#39;n So prevalent as to concerne the mind Of God high-blest, or to incline his will, Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer, Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne Ev&amp;#39;n to the Seat of God. For since I saught By Prayer th&amp;#39; offended Deitie to appease, Kneel&amp;#39;d and before him humbl&amp;#39;d all my heart, Methought I saw him placable and mild, Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew That I was heard with favour; peace returnd Home to my Brest, and to my memorie His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; Which then not minded in dismay, yet now Assures me that the bitterness of death Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee, Eve rightly call&amp;#39;d, Mother of all Mankind, Mother of all things living, since by thee Man is to live, and all things live for Man. To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. Ill worthie I such title should belong To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: But infinite in pardon was my Judge, That I who first brought Death on all, am grac&amp;#39;t The sourse of life; next favourable thou, Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf&amp;#39;st, Farr other name deserving. But the Field To labour calls us now with sweat impos&amp;#39;d, Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, All unconcern&amp;#39;d with our unrest, begins Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, I never from thy side henceforth to stray, Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? Here let us live, though in fall&amp;#39;n state, content. So spake, so wish&amp;#39;d much-humbl&amp;#39;d Eve, but Fate Subscrib&amp;#39;d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips&amp;#39;d After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, First hunter then, pursu&amp;#39;d a gentle brace, Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; Direct to th&amp;#39; Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. Adam observ&amp;#39;d, and with his Eye the chase Pursuing, not unmov&amp;#39;d to Eve thus spake. O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, Which Heav&amp;#39;n by these mute signs in Nature shews Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn Us haply too secure of our discharge From penaltie, because from death releast Some days; how long, and what till then our life, Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, And thither must return and be no more. Why else this double object in our fight Of flight pursu&amp;#39;d in th&amp;#39; Air and ore the ground One way the self-same hour? why in the East Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws O&amp;#39;re the blew Firmament a radiant white, And slow descends, with somthing heav&amp;#39;nly fraught. He err&amp;#39;d not, for by this the heav&amp;#39;nly Bands Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, A glorious Apparition, had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimm&amp;#39;d Adams eye. Not that more glorious, when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw The field Pavilion&amp;#39;d with his Guardians bright; Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd In Dothan, cover&amp;#39;d with a Camp of Fire, Against the Syrian King, who to surprize One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, Warr unproclam&amp;#39;d. The Princely Hierarch In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise Possession of the Garden; hee alone, To find where Adam shelterd, took his way, Not unperceav&amp;#39;d of Adam, who to Eve, While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps Of us will soon determin, or impose New Laws to be observ&amp;#39;d; for I descrie From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill One of the heav&amp;#39;nly Host, and by his Gate None of the meanest, some great Potentate Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie Invests him coming; yet not terrible, That I should fear, nor sociably mild, As Raphael, that I should much confide, But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. He ended; and th&amp;#39; Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes A militarie Vest of purple flowd Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero&amp;#39;s old In time of Truce; lris had dipt the wooff; His starrie Helme unbuckl&amp;#39;d shew&amp;#39;d him prime In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State Inclin&amp;#39;d not, but his coming thus declar&amp;#39;d. Adam, Heav&amp;#39;ns high behest no Preface needs: Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, Defeated of his seisure many dayes Giv&amp;#39;n thee of Grace, wherein thou may&amp;#39;st repent, And one bad act with many deeds well done Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas&amp;#39;d Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime; But longer in this Paradise to dwell Permits not; to remove thee I am come, And send thee from the Garden forth to till The ground whence thou wast tak&amp;#39;n, fitter Soile. He added not, for Adam at the newes Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen Yet all had heard, with audible lament Discover&amp;#39;d soon the place of her retire. O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, Quiet though sad, the respit of that day That must be mortal to us both. O flours, That never will in other Climate grow, My early visitation, and my last At Eev&amp;#39;n, which I bred up with tender hand From the first op&amp;#39;ning bud, and gave ye Names, Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke Your Tribes, and water from th&amp;#39; ambrosial Fount? Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee How shall I part, and whither wander down Into a lower World, to this obscure And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine; Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; Where he abides, think there thy native soile. Adam by this from the cold sudden damp Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, To Michael thus his humble words addressd. Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam&amp;#39;d Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould Thy message, which might else in telling wound, And in performing end us; what besides Of sorrow and dejection and despair Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, Departure from this happy place, our sweet Recess, and onely consolation left Familiar to our eyes, all places else Inhospitable appeer and desolate, Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of him who all things can, I would not cease To wearie him with my assiduous cries: But prayer against his absolute Decree No more availes then breath against the winde, Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: Therefore to his great bidding I submit. This most afflicts me, that departing hence, As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd His blessed count&amp;#39;nance; here I could frequent, With worship, place by place where he voutsaf&amp;#39;d Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree Stood visible, among these Pines his voice I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk&amp;#39;d: So many grateful Altars I would reare Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, Or monument to Ages, and thereon Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and Flours: In yonder nether World where shall I seek His bright appearances, or foot-step trace? For though I fled him angrie, yet recall&amp;#39;d To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. Adam, thou know&amp;#39;st Heav&amp;#39;n his, and all the Earth. Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: All th&amp;#39; Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, No despicable gift; surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confin&amp;#39;d Of Paradise or Eden: this had been Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred All generations, and had hither come From all the ends of th&amp;#39; Earth, to celebrate And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in plaine God is as here, and will be found alike Present, and of his presence many a signe Still following thee, still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal Love, his Face Express, and of his steps the track Divine. Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent To shew thee what shall come in future dayes To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn True patience, and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow, equally enur&amp;#39;d By moderation either state to beare, Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead Safest thy life, and best prepar&amp;#39;d endure Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak&amp;#39;st, As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. To whom thus Adam gratefully repli&amp;#39;d. Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path Thou lead&amp;#39;st me, and to the hand of Heav&amp;#39;n submit, However chast&amp;#39;ning, to the evil turne My obvious breast, arming to overcom By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, If so I may attain. So both ascend In the Visions of God: It was a Hill Of Paradise the highest, from whose top The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken Stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, Whereon for different cause the Tempter set Our second Adam in the Wilderness, To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. His Eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern Fame, the Seat Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul Down to the golden Chersonese, or where The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken Th&amp;#39; Empire of Negus to his utmost Port Ercoco and the less Maritim Kings Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus, Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil&amp;#39;d Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov&amp;#39;d Which that false Fruit that promis&amp;#39;d clearer sight Had bred; then purg&amp;#39;d with Euphrasie and Rue The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; And from the Well of Life three drops instill&amp;#39;d. So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc&amp;#39;d, Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, That Adam now enforc&amp;#39;t to close his eyes, Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: But him the gentle Angel by the hand Soon rais&amp;#39;d, and his attention thus recall&amp;#39;d. Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold Th&amp;#39; effects which thy original crime hath wrought In some to spring from thee, who never touch&amp;#39;d Th&amp;#39; excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir&amp;#39;d, Nor sinn&amp;#39;d thy sin, yet from that sin derive Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. His eyes he op&amp;#39;nd, and beheld a field, Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; Ith&amp;#39; midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, Uncull&amp;#39;d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew&amp;#39;d, On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform&amp;#39;d. His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav&amp;#39;n Consum&amp;#39;d with nimble glance, and grateful steame; The others not, for his was not sincere; Whereat hee inlie rag&amp;#39;d, and as they talk&amp;#39;d, Smote him into the Midriff with a stone That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus&amp;#39;d. Much at that sight was Adam in his heart Dismai&amp;#39;d, and thus in haste to th&amp;#39; Angel cri&amp;#39;d. O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall&amp;#39;n To that meek man, who well had sacrific&amp;#39;d; Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? T&amp;#39; whom Michael thus, hee also mov&amp;#39;d, repli&amp;#39;d. These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come Out of thy loyns; th&amp;#39; unjust the just hath slain, For envie that his Brothers Offering found From Heav&amp;#39;n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact Will be aveng&amp;#39;d, and th&amp;#39; others Faith approv&amp;#39;d Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! But have I now seen Death? Is this the way I must return to native dust? O sight Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen In his first shape on man; but many shapes Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense More terrible at th&amp;#39; entrance then within. Some, as thou saw&amp;#39;st, by violent stroke shall die, By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more In Meats and Drinks which on the Earth shall bring Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know What miserie th&amp;#39; inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on men. Immediately a place Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid Numbers of all diseas&amp;#39;d, all maladies Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, Daemoniac Phrenzie, moaping Melancholie And Moon-struck madness, pining Atrophie, Marasmus, and wide-wasting Pestilence, Dropsies, and Asthma&amp;#39;s, and Joint-racking Rheums. Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; And over them triumphant Death his Dart Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok&amp;#39;t With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long Drie-ey&amp;#39;d behold? Adam could not, but wept, Though not of Woman born; compassion quell&amp;#39;d His best of Man, and gave him up to tears A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, And scarce recovering words his plaint renew&amp;#39;d. O miserable Mankind, to what fall Degraded, to what wretched state reserv&amp;#39;d! Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv&amp;#39;n To be thus wrested from us? rather why Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew What we receive, would either not accept Life offer&amp;#39;d, or soon beg to lay it down, Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus Th&amp;#39; Image of God in man created once So goodly and erect, though faultie since, To such unsightly sufferings be debas&amp;#39;t Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, Retaining still Divine similitude In part, from such deformities be free, And for his Makers Image sake exempt? Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then Forsook them, when themselves they villifi&amp;#39;d To serve ungovern&amp;#39;d appetite, and took His Image whom they serv&amp;#39;d, a brutish vice, Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. Therefore so abject is thir punishment, Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, Or if his likeness, by themselves defac&amp;#39;t While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. I yield it just, said Adam, and submit. But is there yet no other way, besides These painful passages, how we may come To Death, and mix with our connatural dust; There is, said Michael, if thou well observe The rule of not too much, by temperance taught In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, Till many years over thy head return: So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: This is old age; but then thou must outlive Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change To witherd weak and gray; thy Senses then Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne A Melancholy damp of cold and dry To weigh thy Spirits down, and last consume The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong Life much, bent rather how I may be quit Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, Which I must keep till my appointed day Of rendring up, and patiently attend My dissolution. Michael repli&amp;#39;d. Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst Live well, how long or short permit to Heav&amp;#39;n: And now prepare thee for another sight. He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound Of Instruments that made melodious chime Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch Instinct through all proportions low and high Fled and pursu&amp;#39;d transverse the resonant fugue. In other part stood one who at the Forge Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind Into fit moulds prepar&amp;#39;d; from which he formd First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought Fusil or grav&amp;#39;n in mettle. After these, But on the hether side a different sort From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent To worship God aright, and know his works Not hid, nor those things last which might preserve Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: The Men though grave, ey&amp;#39;d them, and let thir eyes Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net Fast caught, they lik&amp;#39;d, and each his liking chose; And now of love they treat till th&amp;#39; Eevning Star Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok&amp;#39;t; With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. Such happy interview and fair event Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, And charming Symphonies attach&amp;#39;d the heart Of Adam, soon enclin&amp;#39;d to admit delight, The bent of Nature; which he thus express&amp;#39;d. True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, Much better seems this Vision, and more hope Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, Created, as thou art, to nobler end Holie and pure, conformitie divine. Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race Who slew his Brother; studious they appere Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg&amp;#39;d none. Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, Yet empty of all good wherein consists Womans domestic honour and chief praise; Bred onely and completed to the taste Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives Religious titl&amp;#39;d them the Sons of God, Shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir fame Ignobly, to the traines and to the smiles Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, (Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. O pittie and shame, that they who to live well Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! But still I see the tenor of Mans woe Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, Said th&amp;#39; Angel, who should better hold his place By wisdome, and superiour gifts receav&amp;#39;d. But now prepare thee for another Scene. He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred Before him, Towns, and rural works between, Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, Single or in Array of Battel rang&amp;#39;d Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; One way a Band select from forage drives A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, But call in aide, which makes a bloody Fray; With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; Where Cattle pastur&amp;#39;d late, now scatterd lies With Carcasses and Arms th&amp;#39; ensanguind Field Deserted: Others to a Citie strong Lay Seige, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, Assaulting; others from the wall defend With Dart and Jav&amp;#39;lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. In other part the scepter&amp;#39;d Haralds call To Council in the Citie Gates: anon Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon In factious opposition, till at last Of middle Age one rising, eminent In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, And Judgment from above: him old and young Exploded and had seiz&amp;#39;d with violent hands, Had not a Cloud descending snatch&amp;#39;d him thence Unseen amid the throng: so violence Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. Adam was all in tears, and to his guide Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death Inhumanly to men, and multiply Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew His Brother; for of whom such massacher Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav&amp;#39;n Rescu&amp;#39;d, had in his Righteousness bin lost? To whom thus Michael. These are the product Of those ill mated Marriages thou saw&amp;#39;st; Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. Such were these Giants, men of high renown; For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir&amp;#39;d, And Valour and Heroic Vertu call&amp;#39;d; To overcome in Battle, and subdue Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done Of triumph, to be styl&amp;#39;d great Conquerours, Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, Destroyers rightlier call&amp;#39;d and Plagues of men. Thus Fame shall be atchiev&amp;#39;d, renown on Earth, And what most merits fame in silence hid. But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst The onely righteous in a World perverse, And therefore hated, therefore so beset With Foes for daring single to be just, And utter odious Truth, that God would come To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. He look&amp;#39;d, and saw the face of things quite chang&amp;#39;d, The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, All now was turn&amp;#39;d to jollitie and game, To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, Marrying or prostituting, as befell, Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. At length a Reverend Sire among them came, And of thir doings great dislike declar&amp;#39;d, And testifi&amp;#39;d against thir wayes; hee oft Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls In Prison under Judgements imminent: But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas&amp;#39;d Contending, and remov&amp;#39;d his Tents farr off; Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, Measur&amp;#39;d by Cubit, length, and breadth, and highth, Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore Contriv&amp;#39;d, and of provisions laid in large For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught Thir order: last the Sire, and his three Sons With thir four Wives; and God made fast the dore. Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove From under Heav&amp;#39;n; the Hills to their supplie Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, Sent up amain; and now the thick&amp;#39;nd Skie Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush&amp;#39;d the Rain Impetuous, and continu&amp;#39;d till the Earth No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting o&amp;#39;re the Waves, all dwellings else Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp Deep under water rould; Sea cover&amp;#39;d Sea, Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces Where luxurie late reign&amp;#39;d, Sea-monsters whelp&amp;#39;d And stabl&amp;#39;d; of Mankind, so numerous late, All left, in one small bottom swum imbark&amp;#39;t. How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, Depopulation; thee another Floud, Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown&amp;#39;d, And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard By th&amp;#39; Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns His Children, all in view destroyd at once; And scarce to th&amp;#39; Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. O Visions ill foreseen! better had I Liv&amp;#39;d ignorant of future, so had borne My part of evil onely, each dayes lot Anough to beare; those now, that were dispenst The burd&amp;#39;n of many Ages, on me light At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, With thought that they must be. Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, And hee the future evil shall no less In apprehension then in substance feel Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, Man is not whom to warne: those few escap&amp;#39;t Famin and anguish will at last consume Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope When violence was ceas&amp;#39;t, and Warr on Earth, All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd With length of happy dayes the race of man; But I was farr deceav&amp;#39;d; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, And whether here the Race of man will end. To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst In Triumph and luxurious wealth, are they First seen in acts of prowess eminent And great exploits, but of true vertu void; Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. The conquerd also, and enslav&amp;#39;d by Warr Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose And fear of God, from whom thir pietie feign&amp;#39;d In sharp contest of Battel found no aide Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords Shall leave them to enjoy; for th&amp;#39; Earth shall bear More then anough, that temperance may be tri&amp;#39;d: So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav&amp;#39;d, Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; One Man except, the onely Son of light In a dark Age, against example good, Against allurement, custom, and a World Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes Shall them admonish, and before them set The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come On thir impenitence; and shall returne Of them derided, but of God observd The one just Man alive; by his command Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, To save himself and household from amidst A World devote to universal rack. No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg&amp;#39;d, And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts Of Heav&amp;#39;n set open on the Earth shall powre Raine day and night, all fountains of the Deep Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, With all his verdure spoil&amp;#39;d, and Trees adrift Down the great River to the op&amp;#39;ning Gulf, And there take root an Iland salt and bare, The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctitie, if none be thither brought By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. And now what further shall ensue, behold. He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie Wrinkl&amp;#39;d the face of Deluge, as decai&amp;#39;d; And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass Gaz&amp;#39;d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt His Sluces, as the Heav&amp;#39;n his windows shut. The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, And after him, the surer messenger, A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; The second time returning, in his Bill An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, Grateful to Heav&amp;#39;n, over his head beholds A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow Conspicuous with three listed colours gay, Betok&amp;#39;ning peace from God, and Cov&amp;#39;nant new. Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad Greatly rejoyc&amp;#39;d, and thus his joy broke forth. O thou who future things canst represent As present, Heav&amp;#39;nly instructer, I revive At this last sight, assur&amp;#39;d that Man shall live With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. Farr less I now lament for one whole World Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce For one Man found so perfet and so just, That God voutsafes to raise another World From him, and all his anger to forget. But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, Distended as the Brow of God appeas&amp;#39;d, Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? To whom th&amp;#39; Archangel. Dextrously thou aim&amp;#39;st; So willingly doth God remit his Ire, Though late repenting him of Man deprav&amp;#39;d, Griev&amp;#39;d at his heart, when looking down he saw The whole Earth fill&amp;#39;d with violence, and all flesh Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov&amp;#39;d, Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, That he relents, not to blot out mankind, And makes a Covenant never to destroy The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set His triple-colour&amp;#39;d Bow, whereon to look And call to mind his Cov&amp;#39;nant: Day and Night, Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, Both Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;AS one who in his journey bates at Noone, Though bent on speed, so heer the Archangel paus&amp;#39;d Betwixt the world destroy&amp;#39;d and world restor&amp;#39;d, If Adam aught perhaps might interpose; Then with transition sweet new Speech resumes. Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end; And Man as from a second stock proceed. Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense: Henceforth what is to com I will relate, Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. This second sours of Men, while yet but few; And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie, With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, With large Wine-offerings pour&amp;#39;d, and sacred Feast, Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam&amp;#39;d, and dwell Long time in peace by Families and Tribes Under paternal rule; till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart, who not content With fair equalitie, fraternal state, Will arrogate Dominion undeserv&amp;#39;d Over his brethren, and quite dispossess Concord and law of Nature from the Earth; Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game) With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse Subjection to his Empire tyrannous: A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl&amp;#39;d Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav&amp;#39;n, Or from Heav&amp;#39;n claming second Sovrantie; And from Rebellion shall derive his name, Though of Rebellion others he accuse. Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns With him or under him to tyrannize, Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell; Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build A Citie and Towre, whose top may reach to Heav&amp;#39;n; And get themselves a name, least far disperst In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost Regardless whether good or evil fame. But God who oft descends to visit men Unseen, and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings, them beholding soon, Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower Obstruct Heav&amp;#39;n Towrs, and in derision sets Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase Quite out thir Native Language, and instead To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud Among the Builders; each to other calls Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav&amp;#39;n And looking down, to see the hubbub strange And hear the din; thus was the building left Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam&amp;#39;d. Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas&amp;#39;d. O execrable Son so to aspire Above his Brethren, to himself assuming Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv&amp;#39;n: He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl Dominion absolute; that right we hold By his donation; but Man over men He made not Lord; such title to himself Reserving, human left from human free. But this Usurper his encroachment proud Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food Will he convey up thither to sustain Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross, And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread? To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr&amp;#39;st That Son, who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue Rational Libertie; yet know withall, Since thy original lapse, true Libertie Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells Twinn&amp;#39;d, and from her hath no dividual being: Reason in man obscur&amp;#39;d, or not obeyd, Immediately inordinate desires And upstart Passions catch the Government From Reason, and to servitude reduce Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits Within himself unworthie Powers to reign Over free Reason, God in judgement just Subjects him from without to violent Lords; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be, Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, But Justice, and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie, Thir inward lost: Witness th&amp;#39; irreverent Son Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse, Servant of Seruants, on his vitious Race. Thus will this latter, as the former World, Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw His presence from among them, and avert His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes; And one peculiar Nation to select From all the rest, of whom to be invok&amp;#39;d, A Nation from one faithful man to spring: Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, While yet the Patriark liv&amp;#39;d, who scap&amp;#39;d the Flood, As to forsake the living God, and fall To worship thir own work in Wood and Stone For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes To call by Vision from his Fathers house, His kindred and false Gods, into a Land Which he will shew him, and from him will raise A mightie Nation, and upon him showre His benediction so, that in his Seed All Nations shall be blest; he straight obeys, Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the Ford To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth With God, who call&amp;#39;d him, in a land unknown. Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine Of Moreh; there by promise he receaves Gift to his Progenie of all that Land; From Hamath Northward to the Desert South (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam&amp;#39;d) From Hermon East to the great Western Sea, Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills. This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest, Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call, A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves, Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs From Canaan, to a Land hereafter call&amp;#39;d Egypt, divided by the River Nile; See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger Son In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that Realme Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race Growing into a Nation, and now grown Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males: Till by two brethren (those two brethren call Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime His people from enthralment, they return With glory and spoile back to thir promis&amp;#39;d Land. But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies To know thir God, or message to regard, Must be compelld by Signes and judgements dire; To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd, Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill With loath&amp;#39;d intrusion, and fill all the land; His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile, Haile mixt with fire must rend th&amp;#39; Egyptian Skie And wheel on th&amp;#39; Earth, devouring where it rouls; What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine, A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds The River-dragon tam&amp;#39;d at length submits To let his sojourners depart, and oft Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice More hard&amp;#39;nd after thaw, till in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass As on drie land between two christal walls, Aw&amp;#39;d by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided, till his rescu&amp;#39;d gain thir shoar: Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, Though present in his Angel, who shall goe Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, By day a Cloud, by night a Pillar of Fire, To guide them in thir journey, and remove Behinde them, while th&amp;#39; obdurat King pursues: All night he will pursue, but his approach Darkness defends between till morning Watch; Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud God looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command Moses once more his potent Rod extends Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys; On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return, And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way, Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. This also shall they gain by thir delay In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found Thir government, and thir great Senate choose Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind: God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top Shall tremble, he descending, will himself In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine To civil Justice, part religious Rites Of sacrifice, informing them, by types And shadows, of that destind Seed to bruise The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech That Moses might report to them his will, And terror cease; he grants what they besaught Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator, whose high Office now Moses in figure beares, to introduce One greater, of whose day he shall foretell, And all the Prophets in thir Age the times Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites Establisht, such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes Among them to set up his Tabernacle, The holy One with mortal Men to dwell: By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram&amp;#39;d Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony, The Records of his Cov&amp;#39;nant, over these A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing The Heav&amp;#39;nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud Shall rest by Day, a fiery gleame by Night, Save when they journie, and at length they come, Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won, Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav&amp;#39;n stand still A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne, Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand, And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon, Till Israel overcome; so call the third From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. Here Adam interpos&amp;#39;d. O sent from Heav&amp;#39;n, Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde Mine eyes true op&amp;#39;ning, and my heart much eas&amp;#39;d, Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest, Favour unmerited by me, who sought Forbidd&amp;#39;n knowledge by forbidd&amp;#39;n means. This yet I apprehend not, why to those Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth So many and so various Laws are giv&amp;#39;n; So many Laws argue so many sins Among them; how can God with such reside? To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them, as of thee begot; And therefore was Law given them to evince Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up Sin against Law to fight; that when they see Law can discover sin, but not remove, Save by those shadowie expiations weak, The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man, Just for unjust, that in such righteousness To them by Faith imputed, they may finde Justification towards God, and peace Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part Perform, and not performing cannot live. So law appears imperfet, and but giv&amp;#39;n With purpose to resign them in full time Up to a better Cov&amp;#39;nant, disciplin&amp;#39;d From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, From imposition of strict Laws, to free Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. And therefore shall not Moses, though of God Highly belov&amp;#39;d, being but the Minister Of Law, his people into Canaan lead; But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call, His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell The adversarie Serpent, and bring back Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac&amp;#39;t Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins National interrupt thir public peace, Provoking God to raise them enemies: From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom The second, both for pietie renownd And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne For ever shall endure; the like shall sing All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock Of David (so I name this King) shall rise A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. But first a long succession must ensue, And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam&amp;#39;d, The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. Such follow him, as shall be registerd Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw&amp;#39;st Left in confusion, Babylon thence call&amp;#39;d. There in captivitie he lets them dwell The space of seventie years, then brings them back, Remembring mercie, and his Cov&amp;#39;nant sworn To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav&amp;#39;n. Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings Thir Lords, whom God dispos&amp;#39;d, the house of God They first re-edifie, and for a while In mean estate live moderate, till grown In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; But first among the Priests dissension springs, Men who attend the Altar, and should most Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons, Then loose it to a stranger, that the true Anointed King Messiah might be born Barr&amp;#39;d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr Unseen before in Heav&amp;#39;n proclaims him com, And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire The Power of the most High; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav&amp;#39;ns. He ceas&amp;#39;d, discerning Adam with such joy Surcharg&amp;#39;d, as had like grief bin dew&amp;#39;d in tears, Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher Of utmost hope! now clear I understand What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, Why our great expectation should be call&amp;#39;d The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, High in the love of Heav&amp;#39;n, yet from my Loynes Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son Of God most High; So God with man unites. Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise Expect with mortal paine: say where and when Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight, As of a Duel, or the local wounds Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil Thy enemie; nor so is overcome Satan, whose fall from Heav&amp;#39;n, a deadlier bruise, Disabl&amp;#39;d not to give thee thy deaths wound: Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, Not by destroying Satan, but his works In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be, But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, Obedience to the Law of God, impos&amp;#39;d On penaltie of death, and suffering death, The penaltie to thy transgression due, And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: So onely can high Justice rest appaid. The Law of God exact he shall fulfill Both by obedience and by love, though love Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment He shall endure by coming in the Flesh To a reproachful life and cursed death, Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe In his redemption, and that his obedience Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits To save them, not thir own, though legal works. For this he shall live hated, be blasphem&amp;#39;d, Seis&amp;#39;d on by force, judg&amp;#39;d, and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, The Law that is against thee, and the sins Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi&amp;#39;d, Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction; so he dies, But soon revives, Death over him no power Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, His death for Man, as many as offerd Life Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace By Faith not void of workes: this God-like act Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy&amp;#39;d, In sin for ever lost from life; this act Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, A gentle wafting to immortal Life. Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer To his Disciples, Men who in his Life Still follow&amp;#39;d him; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learn&amp;#39;d And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve Baptizing in the profluent stream, the signe Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life Pure, and in mind prepar&amp;#39;d, if so befall, For death, like that which the redeemer dy&amp;#39;d. All Nations they shall teach; for from that day Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world; So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. Then to the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heav&amp;#39;ns he shall ascend With victory, triumphing through the aire Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines Through all his Realme, and there confounded leave; Then enter into glory, and resume His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high Above all names in Heav&amp;#39;n; and thence shall come, When this worlds disolution shall be ripe, With glory and power to judge both quick and dead, To judge th&amp;#39; unfaithful dead, but to reward His faithful, and receave them into bliss, Whether in Heav&amp;#39;n or Earth, for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise, far happier place Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. So spake th&amp;#39; Archangel Michael, then paus&amp;#39;d, As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire Replete with joy and wonder thus repli&amp;#39;d. O goodness infinite, goodness immense! That all this good of evil shall produce, And evil turn to good; more wonderful Then that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, Whether I should repent me now of sin By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, To God more glory, more good will to Men From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. But say, if our deliverer up to Heav&amp;#39;n Must reascend, what will betide the few His faithful, left among th&amp;#39; unfaithful herd, The enemies of truth; who then shall guide His people, who defend? will they not deale Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? Be sure they will, said th&amp;#39; Angel; but from Heav&amp;#39;n Hee to his own a Comforter will send, The promise of the Father, who shall dwell His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, To guide them in all truth, and also arme With spiritual Armour, able to resist Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts, What man can do against them, not affraid, Though to the death, against such cruelties With inward consolations recompenc&amp;#39;t, And oft supported so as shall amaze Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends To evangelize the Nations, then on all Baptiz&amp;#39;d, shall them with wondrous gifts endue To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heav&amp;#39;n: at length Thir Ministry perform&amp;#39;d, and race well run, Thir doctrine and thir story written left, They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav&amp;#39;n To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition, and the truth With superstitions and traditions taint, Left onely in those written Records pure, Though not but by the Spirit understood. Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, Places and titles, and with these to joine Secular power, though feigning still to act By spiritual, to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv&amp;#39;n To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible? yet many will presume: Whence heavie persecution shall arise On all who in the worship persevere Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes Religion satisfi&amp;#39;d; Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, To good malignant, to bad men benigne, Under her own waight groaning till the day Appeer of respiration to the just, And vengeance to the wicked, at return Of him so lately promis&amp;#39;d to thy aid The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, Last in the Clouds from Heav&amp;#39;n to be reveald In glory of the Father, to dissolve Satan with his perverted World, then raise From the conflagrant mass, purg&amp;#39;d and refin&amp;#39;d, New Heav&amp;#39;ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. He ended; and thus Adam last reply&amp;#39;d. How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, Measur&amp;#39;d this transient World, the Race of time, Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this Vessel can containe; Beyond which was my folly to aspire. Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, And love with fear the onely God, to walk As in his presence, ever to observe His providence, and on him sole depend, Mercifull over all his works, with good Still overcoming evil, and by small Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie, And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; Taught this by his example whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. To whom thus also th&amp;#39; Angel last repli&amp;#39;d: This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe Of wisdome; hope no higher, though all the Starrs Thou knewst by name, and all th&amp;#39; ethereal Powers, All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, Or works of God in Heav&amp;#39;n, Aire, Earth, or Sea, And all the riches of this World enjoydst, And all the rule, one Empire; onely add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, Add vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, By name to come call&amp;#39;d Charitie, the soul Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess A paradise within thee, happier farr. Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm&amp;#39;d Portending good, and all her spirits compos&amp;#39;d To meek submission: thou at season fit Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, The great deliverance by her Seed to come (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. That ye may live, which will be many dayes, Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer&amp;#39;d With meditation on the happie end. He ended, and they both descend the Hill; Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak&amp;#39;t; And thus with words not sad she him receav&amp;#39;d. Whence thou returnst, and whither wentst, I know; For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, Which he hath sent propitious, some great good Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee Art all things under Heav&amp;#39;n, all places thou, Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence. This further consolation yet secure I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, By mee the Promis&amp;#39;d Seed shall all restore. So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard Well pleas&amp;#39;d, but answer&amp;#39;d not; for now too nigh Th&amp;#39; Archangel stood, and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station, all in bright array The Cherubim descended; on the ground Gliding meteorous, as Ev&amp;#39;ning Mist Ris&amp;#39;n from a River o&amp;#39;re the marish glides, And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel Homeward returning. High in Front advanc&amp;#39;t, The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz&amp;#39;d Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat In either hand the hastning Angel caught Our lingring Parents, and to th&amp;#39; Eastern Gate Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer&amp;#39;d. They looking back, all th&amp;#39; Eastern side beheld Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, Wav&amp;#39;d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate With dreadful Faces throng&amp;#39;d and fierie Armes: Som natural tears they drop&amp;#39;d, but wip&amp;#39;d them soon; The World was all before them, where to choose Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, Through Eden took thir solitarie way.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold, Satan exalted sat, by merit rais&amp;#39;d To that bad eminence; and from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue Vain Warr with Heav&amp;#39;n, and by success untaught His proud imaginations thus displaid. Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav&amp;#39;n, For since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall&amp;#39;n, I give not Heav&amp;#39;n for lost. From this descent Celestial vertues rising, will appear More glorious and more dread then from no fall, And trust themselves to fear no second fate: Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav&amp;#39;n Did first create your Leader, next free choice, With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss Thus farr at least recover&amp;#39;d, hath much more Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne Yielded with full consent. The happier state In Heav&amp;#39;n, which follows dignity, might draw Envy from each inferior; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Formost to stand against the Thunderers aim Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain? where there is then no good For which to strive, no strife can grow up there From Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence, none, whose portion is so small Of present pain, that with ambitious mind Will covet more. With this advantage then To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, More then can be in Heav&amp;#39;n, we now return To claim our just inheritance of old, Surer to prosper then prosperity Could have assur&amp;#39;d us; and by what best way, Whether of open Warr or covert guile, We now debate; who can advise, may speak. He ceas&amp;#39;d, and next him Moloc, Scepter&amp;#39;d King Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heav&amp;#39;n; now fiercer by despair: His trust was with th&amp;#39; Eternal to be deem&amp;#39;d Equal in strength, and rather then be less Car&amp;#39;d not to be at all; with that care lost Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse He reck&amp;#39;d not, and these words thereafter spake. My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles, More unexpert, I boast not: them let those Contrive who need, or when they need, not now. For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here Heav&amp;#39;ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns By our delay? no, let us rather choose Arm&amp;#39;d with Hell flames and fury all at once O&amp;#39;re Heav&amp;#39;ns high Towrs to force resistless way, Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels; and his Throne it self Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire, His own invented Torments. But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse. Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok&amp;#39;n Rear Insulting, and pursu&amp;#39;d us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low? Th&amp;#39; ascent is easie then; Th&amp;#39; event is fear&amp;#39;d; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy&amp;#39;d: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv&amp;#39;n out from bliss, condemn&amp;#39;d In this abhorred deep to utter woe; Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge Inexorably, and the torturing hour Calls us to Penance? More destroy&amp;#39;d then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag&amp;#39;d, Will either quite consume us, and reduce To nothing this essential, happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being: Or if our substance be indeed Divine, And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav&amp;#39;n, And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: Which if not Victory is yet Revenge. He ended frowning, and his look denounc&amp;#39;d Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous To less then Gods. On th&amp;#39; other side up rose Belial, in act more graceful and humane; A fairer person lost not Heav&amp;#39;n; he seemd For dignity compos&amp;#39;d and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear The better reason, to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas&amp;#39;d the ear, And with perswasive accent thus began. I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, As not behind in hate; if what was urg&amp;#39;d Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success: When he who most excels in fact of Arms, In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution, as the scope Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav&amp;#39;n are fill&amp;#39;d With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav&amp;#39;ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th&amp;#39; Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious. Thus repuls&amp;#39;d, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th&amp;#39; Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, Though full of pain, this intellectual being, Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, To perish rather, swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night, Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, Let this be good, whether our angry Foe Can give it, or will ever? how he can Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, Belike through impotence, or unaware, To give his Enemies thir wish, and end Them in his anger, whom his anger saves To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, Reserv&amp;#39;d and destin&amp;#39;d to Eternal woe; Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? What when we fled amain, pursu&amp;#39;d and strook With Heav&amp;#39;ns afflicting Thunder, and besought The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem&amp;#39;d A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay Chain&amp;#39;d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindl&amp;#39;d those grim fires Awak&amp;#39;d should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the flames? or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us? what if all Her stores were open&amp;#39;d, and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads; while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious warr, Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl&amp;#39;d Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; There to converse with everlasting groans, Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or conceal&amp;#39;d, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav&amp;#39;ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the Race of Heav&amp;#39;n Thus trampl&amp;#39;d, thus expell&amp;#39;d to suffer here Chains and these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv&amp;#39;d, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent&amp;#39;rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov&amp;#39;d Not mind us not offending, satisfi&amp;#39;d With what is punish&amp;#39;t; whence these raging fires Will slack&amp;#39;n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur&amp;#39;d not feel, Or chang&amp;#39;d at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe. Thus Belial with words cloath&amp;#39;d in reasons garb Counsel&amp;#39;d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. Either to disinthrone the King of Heav&amp;#39;n We warr, if warr be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then May hope when everlasting Fathe shall yeild To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife: The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter: for what place can be for us Within Heav&amp;#39;ns bound, unless Heav&amp;#39;ns Lord supream We overpower? Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos&amp;#39;d, to celebrate his Throne With warbl&amp;#39;d Hymns, and to his God head sing Forc&amp;#39;t Halleluia&amp;#39;s; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings. This must be our task In Heav&amp;#39;n this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain&amp;#39;d Unacceptable, though in Heav&amp;#39;n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appeer Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse We can create, and in what place so e&amp;#39;re Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and indurance. This deep world Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav&amp;#39;ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur&amp;#39;d, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must&amp;#39;ring thir rage, and Heav&amp;#39;n resembles Hell? As he our darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav&amp;#39;n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang&amp;#39;d Into their temper; which must needs remove The sensible of pain. All things invite To peaceful Counsels, and the settl&amp;#39;d State Of order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regard Of what we are and were, dismissing quite All thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise. He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld Th&amp;#39; Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain The sound of blustring winds, which all night long Had rous&amp;#39;d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay After the Tempest: Such applause was heard As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas&amp;#39;d, Advising peace: for such another Field They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael Wrought still within them; and no less desire To found this nether Empire, which might rise By pollicy, and long process of time, In emulation opposite to Heav&amp;#39;n. Which when Beelzebub perceiv&amp;#39;d, then whom, Satan except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem&amp;#39;d A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and public care; And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav&amp;#39;n Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now Must we renounce, and changing stile be call&amp;#39;d Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote Inclines, here to continue, and build up here A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, And know not that the King of Heav&amp;#39;n hath doom&amp;#39;d This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt From Heav&amp;#39;ns high jurisdiction, in new League Banded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far remov&amp;#39;d, Under th&amp;#39; inevitable curb, reserv&amp;#39;d His captive multitude: For he, be sure In heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt, but over Hell extend His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav&amp;#39;n. What sit we then projecting peace and Warr? Warr hath determin&amp;#39;d us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none Voutsaf&amp;#39;t or sought; for what peace will be giv&amp;#39;n To us enslav&amp;#39;d, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam&amp;#39;d reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav&amp;#39;n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find Some easier enterprize? There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav&amp;#39;n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of some new Race call&amp;#39;d Man, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour&amp;#39;d more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc&amp;#39;d among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav&amp;#39;ns whol circumference, confirm&amp;#39;d. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, Or substance, how endu&amp;#39;d, and what thir Power, And where thir weakness, how attempted best, By force or suttlety: Though Heav&amp;#39;n be shut, And Heav&amp;#39;ns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength, this place may lye expos&amp;#39;d The utmost border of his Kingdom, left To their defence who hold it: here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achiev&amp;#39;d By sudden onset, either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation, or possess All as our own, and drive as we were driven, The punie habitants, or if not drive, Seduce them to our Party, that thir God May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works. This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joy In our Confusion, and our joy upraise In his disturbance; when his darling Sons HurI&amp;#39;d headlong to partake with us, shall curse Thir frail Original, and faded bliss, Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth Attempting, or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis&amp;#39;d By Satan, and in part propos&amp;#39;d: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice, to confound the race Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve, done all to spite The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves His glory to augment. The bold design Pleas&amp;#39;d highly those infernal States, and joy Sparkl&amp;#39;d in all thir eyes; with full assent They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. Well have ye judg&amp;#39;d, well ended long debate, Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, Great things resolv&amp;#39;d; which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms And opportune excursion we may chance Re-enter Heav&amp;#39;n; or else in some milde Zone Dwell not unvisited of Heav&amp;#39;ns fair Light Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires Shall breathe her balme. But first whom shall we send In search of this new world, whom shall we find Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottom&amp;#39;d infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round? Here he had need All circumspection, and we now no less Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, The weight of all and our last hope relies. This said, he sat; and expectation held His look suspence, awaiting who appeer&amp;#39;d To second, or oppose, or undertake The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each In others count&amp;#39;nance read his own dismay Astonisht: none among the choice and prime Of those Heav&amp;#39;n-warring Champions could be found So hardie as to proffer or accept Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais&amp;#39;d Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth, unmov&amp;#39;d thus spake. O Progeny of Heav&amp;#39;n, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seis&amp;#39;d us, though undismaid: long is the way And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light; Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, Outrageous to devour, immures us round Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant Barr&amp;#39;d over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung&amp;#39;d in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into whatever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov&amp;#39;ranty, adorn&amp;#39;d With splendor, arm&amp;#39;d with power, if aught propos&amp;#39;d And judg&amp;#39;d of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterr Mee from attempting. Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour, due alike To him who Reigns, and so much to him due Of hazard more, as he above the rest High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty Powers, Terror of Heav&amp;#39;n, though fall&amp;#39;n; intend at home, While here shall be our home, what best may ease The present misery, and render Hell More tollerable; if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive, or slack the pain Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all: this enterprize None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose The Monarch, and prevented all reply, Prudent, least from his resolution rais&amp;#39;d Others among the chief might offer now (Certain to be refus&amp;#39;d) what erst they feard; And so refus&amp;#39;d might in opinion stand His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they Dreaded not more th&amp;#39; adventure then his voice Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone; and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav&amp;#39;n: Nor fail&amp;#39;d they to express how much they prais&amp;#39;d, That for the general safety he despis&amp;#39;d His own: for neither do the Spirits damn&amp;#39;d Loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, Or clos ambition varnisht o&amp;#39;re with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o&amp;#39;respread Heav&amp;#39;ns chearful face, the lowring Element Scowls ore the dark&amp;#39;nd lantskip Snow, or showre; If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his ev&amp;#39;ning beam, the fields revive, The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn&amp;#39;d Firm concord holds, men onely disagree Of Creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: As if (which might induce us to accord) Man had not hellish foes anow besides, That day and night for his destruction waite. The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv&amp;#39;d; and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers, Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd Alone th&amp;#39; Antagonist of Heav&amp;#39;n, nor less Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, And God-like imitated State; him round A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos&amp;#39;d With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. Then of thir Session ended they bid cry With Trumpets regal sound the great result: Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie By Haralds voice explain&amp;#39;d: the hollow Abyss Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell With deafning shout, return&amp;#39;d them loud acclaim. Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais&amp;#39;d By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers Disband, and wandring, each his several way Pursues, as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain The irksom hours, till this great Chief return. Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend, As at th&amp;#39; Olympian Games or Pythian fields; Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag&amp;#39;d in the troubl&amp;#39;d Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav&amp;#39;n the welkin burns. Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when Alcides from Oechalia Crown&amp;#39;d With conquest, felt th&amp;#39; envenom&amp;#39;d robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th&amp;#39; Euboic Sea. Others more milde, Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir Song was partial, but the harmony (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) Others apart sat on a Hill retir&amp;#39;d, In thoughts more elevate, and reason&amp;#39;d high Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate, Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argu&amp;#39;d then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish, and excite Fallacious hope, or arm th&amp;#39; obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps Might yield them easier habitation, bend Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; Cocytus, nam&amp;#39;d of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, Lethe the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air Burns frore, and cold performs th&amp;#39; effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail&amp;#39;d, At certain revolutions all the damn&amp;#39;d Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this Lethean Sound Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, All in one moment, and so neer the brink; But Fate withstands, and to oppose th&amp;#39; attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The Ford, and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight, as once it fled The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on In confus&amp;#39;d march forlorn, th&amp;#39; adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast View&amp;#39;d first thir lamentable lot, and found No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile They pass&amp;#39;d, and many a Region dolorous, O&amp;#39;re many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe, Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, A Universe of death, which God by curse Created evil, for evil only good, Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable, and worse Than Fables yet have feign&amp;#39;d, or fear conceiv&amp;#39;d, Gorgons and Hydra&amp;#39;s, and Chimera&amp;#39;s dire. Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, Satan with thoughts inflam&amp;#39;d of highest design, Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; som times He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares Up to the fiery Concave touring high. As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri&amp;#39;d Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem&amp;#39;d Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass, Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, Impenetrable, impal&amp;#39;d with circling fire, Yet unconsum&amp;#39;d. Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem&amp;#39;d Woman to the waste, and fair, But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm&amp;#39;d With mortal sting: about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark&amp;#39;d With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, If aught disturb&amp;#39;d thir noyse, into her woomb, And kennel there, yet there still bark&amp;#39;d and howl&amp;#39;d, Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd than these Vex&amp;#39;d Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call&amp;#39;d In secret, riding through the Air she comes Lur&amp;#39;d with the smell of infant blood, to dance With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape, If shape it might be call&amp;#39;d that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call&amp;#39;d that shadow seem&amp;#39;d, For each seem&amp;#39;d either; black it stood as Night, Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem&amp;#39;d his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. Satan was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th&amp;#39; undaunted Fiend what this might be admir&amp;#39;d, Admir&amp;#39;d, not fear&amp;#39;d; God and his Son except, Created thing naught valu&amp;#39;d he nor shun&amp;#39;d; And with disdainful look thus first began. Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, That dar&amp;#39;st, though grim and terrible, advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, That be assur&amp;#39;d, without leave askt of thee: Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav&amp;#39;n. To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply&amp;#39;d, Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, Who first broke peace in Heav&amp;#39;n and Faith, till then Unbrok&amp;#39;n, and in proud rebellious Arms Drew after him the third part of Heav&amp;#39;ns Sons Conjur&amp;#39;d against the highest, for which both Thou And they outcast from God, are here condemn&amp;#39;d To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain? And reck&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav&amp;#39;n, Hell-doom&amp;#39;d, and breath&amp;#39;st defiance here and scorn Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment, False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, So speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold More dreadful and deform: on th&amp;#39; other side Incenst with indignation Satan stood Unterrifi&amp;#39;d, and like a Comet burn&amp;#39;d, That fires the length of Ophiucus huge In th&amp;#39; Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head Level&amp;#39;d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands No second stroke intend, and such a frown Each cast at th&amp;#39; other, as when two black Clouds With Heav&amp;#39;ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on Over the Caspian, then stand front to front Hov&amp;#39;ring a space, till Winds the signal blow To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; For never but once more was either like To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds Had been achiev&amp;#39;d, whereof all Hell had rung, Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, Ris&amp;#39;n, and with hideous outcry rush&amp;#39;d between. O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry&amp;#39;d, Against thy only Son? What fury O Son, Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart Against thy Fathers head? and know&amp;#39;st for whom; For him who sits above and laughs the while At thee ordain&amp;#39;d his drudge, to execute What e&amp;#39;re his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore, then these to her Satan return&amp;#39;d: So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange Thou interposest, that my sudden hand Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends; till first I know of thee, What thing thou art, thus double-form&amp;#39;d, and why In this infernal Vaile first met thou call&amp;#39;st Me Father, and that Fantasm ca11&amp;#39;st my Son? I know thee not, nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable then him and thee. T&amp;#39; whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply&amp;#39;d; Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem Now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair In Heav&amp;#39;n, when at th&amp;#39; Assembly, and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combin&amp;#39;d In bold conspiracy against Heav&amp;#39;ns King, All on a sudden miserable pain Surpris&amp;#39;d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth, till on the left side op&amp;#39;ning wide, Likest to thee in shape and count&amp;#39;nance bright, Then shining heav&amp;#39;nly fair, a Goddess arm&amp;#39;d Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis&amp;#39;d All th&amp;#39; Host of Heav&amp;#39;n; back they recoild affraid At first, and call&amp;#39;d me Sin, and for a Sign Portentous held me; but familiar grown, I pleas&amp;#39;d, and with attractive graces won The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing Becam&amp;#39;st enamour&amp;#39;d, and such joy thou took&amp;#39;st With me in secret, that my womb conceiv&amp;#39;d A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose, And fields were fought in Heav&amp;#39;n; wherein remaind (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean: down they fell Driv&amp;#39;n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down Into this Deep, and in the general fall I also; at which time this powerful Key Into my hand was giv&amp;#39;n, with charge to keep These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass Without my op&amp;#39;ning. Pensive here I sat Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. At last this odious offspring whom thou seest Thine own begotten, breaking violent way Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew Transform&amp;#39;d: but he my inbred enemie Forth issu&amp;#39;d, brandishing his fatal Dart Made to destroy: I fled, and cry&amp;#39;d out Death; Hell trembl&amp;#39;d at the hideous Name, and sigh&amp;#39;d From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. I fled, but he pursu&amp;#39;d (though more, it seems, Inflam&amp;#39;d with lust then rage) and swifter far, Mee overtook his mother all dismaid, And in embraces forcible and foule Ingendring with me, of that rape begot These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv&amp;#39;d And hourly born, with sorrow infinite To me, for when they list into the womb That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, That rest or intermission none I find. Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, And me his Parent would full soon devour For want of other prey, but that he knows His end with mine involvd; and knows that I Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc&amp;#39;d. But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, Though temper&amp;#39;d heav&amp;#39;nly, for that mortal dint, Save he who reigns above, none can resist. She finish&amp;#39;d, and the suttle Fiend his lore Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. Dear Daughter, since thou claim&amp;#39;st me for thy Sire, And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heav&amp;#39;n, and joys Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know I come no enemie, but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain, Both him and thee, and all the heav&amp;#39;nly Host Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm&amp;#39;d Fell with us from on high: from them I go This uncouth errand sole, and one for all My self expose, with lonely steps to tread Th&amp;#39; unfounded deep, and through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now Created vast and round, a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heav&amp;#39;n, and therein plac&amp;#39;t A race of upstart Creatures, to supply Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov&amp;#39;d, Least Heav&amp;#39;n surcharg&amp;#39;d with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught Then this more secret now design&amp;#39;d, I haste To know, and this once known, shall soon return, And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm&amp;#39;d With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill&amp;#39;d Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. He ceas&amp;#39;d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear His famine should be fill&amp;#39;d, and blest his mawe Destin&amp;#39;d to that good hour: no less rejoyc&amp;#39;d His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. The key of this infernal Pit by due, And by command of Heav&amp;#39;ns all-powerful King I keep, by him forbidden to unlock These Adamantine Gates; against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart, Fearless to be o&amp;#39;rmatcht by living might. But what ow I to his commands above Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, To sit in hateful Office here confin&amp;#39;d, Inhabitant of Heav&amp;#39;n, and heav&amp;#39;nlie-born, Here in perpetual agonie and pain, With terrors and with clamors compasst round Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou My being gav&amp;#39;st me; whom should I obey But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss, among The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, Which but her self not all the Stygian powers Could once have mov&amp;#39;d; then in the key-hole turns Th&amp;#39; intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease Unfast&amp;#39;ns: on a sudden op&amp;#39;n flie With impetuous recoile and jarring sound Th&amp;#39; infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook Of Erebus. She op&amp;#39;nd, but to shut Excel&amp;#39;d her power; the Gates wide op&amp;#39;n stood, That with extended wings a Bannerd Host Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. Before thir eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound, Without dimension, where length, breadth, &amp;amp; highth, And time and place are lost; where eldest Night And Chaos. Ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand. For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag Of each his Faction, in thir several Clanns, Light-arm&amp;#39;d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, Swarm populous, unnumber&amp;#39;d as the Sands Of Barca or Cyrene&amp;#39;s torrid soil, Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere, Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, And by decision more imbroiles the fray By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss, The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt Confus&amp;#39;dly, and which thus must ever fight, Unless th&amp;#39; Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more Worlds, Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and look&amp;#39;d a while, Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal&amp;#39;d With noises loud and ruinous (to compare Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, With all her battering Engines bent to rase Som Capital City; or less then if this frame Of Heav&amp;#39;n were falling, and these Elements In mutinie had from her Axle torn The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets A vast vacuitie: all unawares Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour Down had been falling, had not by ill chance The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him As many miles aloft: that furie stay&amp;#39;d, Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth Had from his wakeful custody purloind The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: At length a universal hubbub wilde Of stunning sounds and voices all confus&amp;#39;d Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, Undaunted to meet there what ever power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron&amp;#39;d Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, And Discord with a thousand various mouths. T&amp;#39; whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy, With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint Wandring this darksome Desart, as my way, Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heav&amp;#39;n; or if som other place From your Dominion won, th&amp;#39; Ethereal King Possesses lately, thither to arrive I travel this profound, direct my course; Directed no mean recompence it brings To your behoof, if I that Region lost, All usurpation thence expell&amp;#39;d, reduce To her original darkness and your sway (Which is my present journey) and once more Erect the Standard there of ancient Night; Yours be th&amp;#39; advantage all, mine the revenge. Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incompos&amp;#39;d Answer&amp;#39;d. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, That mighty leading Angel, who of late Made head against Heav&amp;#39;ns King, though overthrown. I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, Confusion worse confounded; and Heav&amp;#39;n Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence; if all I can will serve, That little which is left so to defend, Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World Hung ore my Realm, link&amp;#39;d in a golden Chain To that side Heav&amp;#39;n from whence your Legions fell: If that way be your walk, you have not farr; So much the neerer danger; go and speed; Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. He ceas&amp;#39;d; and Satan staid not to reply, But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, With fresh alacritie and force renew&amp;#39;d Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock Of fighting Elements, on all sides round Environ&amp;#39;d wins his way; harder beset And more endanger&amp;#39;d, then when Argo pass&amp;#39;d Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd Charybdis, and by th&amp;#39; other whirlpool steard. So he with difficulty and labour hard Mov&amp;#39;d on, with difficulty and labour hee; But hee once past, soon after when man fell, Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain Following his track, such was the will of Heav&amp;#39;n, Pav&amp;#39;d after him a broad and beat&amp;#39;n way Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf Tamely endur&amp;#39;d a Bridge of wondrous length From Hell continu&amp;#39;d reaching th&amp;#39; utmost Orbe Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse With easie intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals, except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace. But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav&amp;#39;n Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire As from her outmost works a brok&amp;#39;d foe With tumult less and with less hostile din, That Satan with less toil, and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold Farr off th&amp;#39; Empyreal Heav&amp;#39;n, extended wide In circuit, undetermind square or round, With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn&amp;#39;d Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;HAil holy Light, ofspring of Heav&amp;#39;n first-born, Or of th&amp;#39; Eternal Coeternal beam May I express thee unblam&amp;#39;d? since God is light, And never but in unapproached light Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, Bright effluence of bright essence increate. Or hear&amp;#39;st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun, Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest The rising world of waters dark and deep, Won from the void and formless infinite. Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, Escap&amp;#39;t the Stygian Pool, though long detain&amp;#39;d In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne With other notes then to th&amp;#39; Orphean Lyre I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night, Taught by the heav&amp;#39;nly Muse to venture down The dark descent, and up to reascend, Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe, And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou Revisit&amp;#39;st not these eyes, that rowle in vain To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, Or dim suffusion veild. Yet not the more Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill, Smit with the love of sacred Song; but chief Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget Those other two equal&amp;#39;d with me in Fate, So were I equal&amp;#39;d with them in renown, Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old. Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid Tunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of Ev&amp;#39;n or Morn, Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose, Or flocks, or heards, or human face divine; But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark Surrounds me, from the chearful wayes of men Cut off, and for the Book of knowledg fair Presented with a Universal blanc Of Natures works to mee expung&amp;#39;d and ras&amp;#39;d, And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. So much the rather thou Celestial light Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight. Now had the Almighty Father from above, From the pure Empyrean where he sits High Thron&amp;#39;d above all highth, bent down his eye, His own works and their works at once to view: About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv&amp;#39;d Beatitude past utterance; on his right The radiant image of his Glory sat, His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld Our two first Parents, yet the onely two Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac&amp;#39;t, Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love In blissful solitude; he then survey&amp;#39;d Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heav&amp;#39;n on this side Night In the dun Air sublime, and ready now To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet On the bare outside of this World, that seem&amp;#39;d Firm land imbosom&amp;#39;d without Firmament, Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. Him God beholding from his prospect high, Wherein past, present, future he beholds, Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake. Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds Prescrib&amp;#39;d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems On desparate reveng, that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head. And now Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way Not farr off Heav&amp;#39;n, in the Precincts of light, Directly towards the new created World, And Man there plac&amp;#39;t, with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy, or worse, By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert For man will hark&amp;#39;n to his glozing lyes, And easily transgress the sole Command, Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall, Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee All he could have; I made him just and right, Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Such I created all th&amp;#39; Ethereal Powers And Spirits, both them who stood and them who faild; Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, Not what they would? what praise could they receive? What pleasure I from such obedience paid, When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, Made passive both, had servd necessitie, Not mee. They therefore as to right belongd, So were created, nor can justly accuse Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate, As if predestination over-rul&amp;#39;d Thir will, dispos&amp;#39;d by absolute Decree Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, Which had no less prov&amp;#39;d certain unforeknown. So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, They trespass, Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formd them free, and free they must remain, Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain&amp;#39;d Thir freedom, they themselves ordain&amp;#39;d thir fall. The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, Self-tempted, self-deprav&amp;#39;d: Man falls deceiv&amp;#39;d By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, Through Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine. Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill&amp;#39;d All Heav&amp;#39;n, and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus&amp;#39;d: Beyond compare the Son of God was seen Most glorious, in him all his Father shon Substantially express&amp;#39;d, and in his face Divine compassion visibly appeerd, Love without end, and without measure Grace, Which uttering thus he to his Father spake. O Father, gracious was that word which clos&amp;#39;d Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; For which both Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth shall high extoll Thy praises, with th&amp;#39; innumerable sound Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne Encompass&amp;#39;d shall resound thee ever blest. For should Man finally be lost, should Man Thy creature late so lov&amp;#39;d, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd With his own folly? that be from thee farr, That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judg Of all things made, and judgest onely right. Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, Or proud return though to his heavier doom, Yet with revenge accomplish&amp;#39;t and to Hell Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be questiond and blaspheam&amp;#39;d without defence. To whom the great Creatour thus reply&amp;#39;d. O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, Son of my bosom, Son who art alone My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, All hast thou spok&amp;#39;n as my thoughts are, all As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: Man shall not quite be lost, but sav&amp;#39;d who will, Yet not of will in him, but grace in me Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall&amp;#39;d By sin to foul exorbitant desires; Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe, By me upheld, that he may know how frail His fall&amp;#39;n condition is, and to me ow All his deliv&amp;#39;rance, and to none but me. Some I have chosen of peculiar grace Elect above the rest; so is my will: The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes Th&amp;#39; incensed Deitie, while offerd grace Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, What may sufflce, and soft&amp;#39;n stonie hearts To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. To Prayer, repentance, and obedience due, Though but endevord with sincere intent, Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. And I will place within them as a guide My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear, Light after light well us&amp;#39;d they shall attain, And to the end persisting, safe arrive. This my long sufferance and my day of grace They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; But hard be hard&amp;#39;nd, blind be blinded more, That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; And none but such from mercy I exclude. But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns Against the high Supremacie of Heav&amp;#39;n, Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, To expiate his Treason hath naught left, But to destruction sacred and devote, He with his whole posteritie must dye, Dye hee or Justice must; unless for him Som other able, and as willing, pay The rigid satisfaction, death for death. Say Heav&amp;#39;nly powers, where shall we find such love, Which of ye will be mortal to redeem Mans mortal crime, and just th&amp;#39; unjust to save, Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? He ask&amp;#39;d, but all the Heav&amp;#39;nly Quire stood mute, And silence was in Heav&amp;#39;n: on mans behalf Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. And now without redemption all mankind Must have bin lost, adjudg&amp;#39;d to Death and Hell By doom severe, had not the Son of God, In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, His dearest mediation thus renewd. Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, The speediest of thy winged messengers, To visit all thy creatures, and to all Comes unprevented, unimplor&amp;#39;d, unsought, Happie for man, so coming; he her aide Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; Attonement for himself or offering meet, Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; Account mee man; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee Freely put off, and for him lastly dye Well pleas&amp;#39;d, on me let Death wreck all his rage; Under his gloomie power I shall not long Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, Though now to Death I yield, and am his due All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule For ever with corruption there to dwell; But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue My vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm&amp;#39;d. I through the ample Air in Triumph high Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show The powers of darkness bound. Thou at the sight Pleas&amp;#39;d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, While by thee rais&amp;#39;d I ruin all my Foes, Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: Then with the multitude of my redeemd Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud Of anger shall remain, but peace assur&amp;#39;d, And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. His words here ended, but his meek aspect Silent yet spake, and breath&amp;#39;d immortal love To mortal men, above which only shon Filial obedience: as a sacrifice Glad to be offer&amp;#39;d, he attends the will Of his great Father. Admiration seis&amp;#39;d All Heav&amp;#39;n, what this might mean, and whither tend Wondring; but soon th&amp;#39; Almighty thus reply&amp;#39;d: O thou in Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth the only peace Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou My sole complacence! well thou know&amp;#39;st how dear, To me are all my works, nor Man the least Though last created, that for him I spare Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem, Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyn; And be thy self Man among men on Earth, Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son. As in him perish all men, so in thee As from a second root shall be restor&amp;#39;d, As many as are restor&amp;#39;d, without thee none. His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit Imputed shall absolve them who renounce Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, And live in thee transplanted, and from thee Receive new life. So Man, as is most just, Shall satisfie for Man, be judg&amp;#39;d and die, And dying rise, and rising with him raise His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. So Heav&amp;#39;nly love shall outdoo Hellish hate Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate So easily destroy&amp;#39;d, and still destroyes In those who, when they may, accept not grace. Nor shalt thou by descending to assume Mans Nature, less&amp;#39;n or degrade thine owne. Because thou hast, though Thron&amp;#39;d in highest bliss Equal to God, and equally enjoying God-like fruition, quitted all to save A World from utter loss, and hast been found By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, Found worthiest to be so by being Good, Farr more then Great or High; because in thee Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reign Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, Anointed universal King, all Power I give thee, reign for ever, and assume Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; When thou attended gloriously from Heav&amp;#39;n Shalt in the Sky appeer, and from thee send The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes The living, and forthwith the cited dead Of all past Ages to the general Doom Shall hast&amp;#39;n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. Then all thy Saints assembl&amp;#39;d, thou shalt judge Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring New Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell, And after all thir tribulations long See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, For regal Scepter then no more shall need, God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods, Adore him, who to compass all this dies, Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. No sooner had th&amp;#39; Almighty ceas&amp;#39;t, but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav&amp;#39;n rung With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna&amp;#39;s filld Th&amp;#39; eternal Regions: lowly reverent Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence To Heav&amp;#39;n remov&amp;#39;d where first it grew, there grows, And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn Rowls o&amp;#39;re Elisian Flours her Amber stream; With these that never fade the Spirits elect Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath&amp;#39;d with beams, Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon Impurpl&amp;#39;d with Celestial Roses smil&amp;#39;d. Then Crown&amp;#39;d again thir gold&amp;#39;n Harps they took, Harps ever tun&amp;#39;d, that glittering by thir side Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet Of charming symphonie they introduce Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine Melodious part, such concord is in Heav&amp;#39;n. Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, Eternal King; thee Author of all being, Fountain of Light, thy self invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit&amp;#39;st Thron&amp;#39;d inaccessible, but when thou shad&amp;#39;st The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, Yet dazle Heav&amp;#39;n, that brightest Seraphim Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. Thee next they sang of all Creation first, Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, In whose conspicuous count&amp;#39;nance, without cloud Made visible, th&amp;#39; Almighty Father shines, Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, Transfus&amp;#39;d on thee his ample Spirit rests. Hee Heav&amp;#39;n of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created, and by thee threw down Th&amp;#39; aspiring Dominations: thou that day Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook Heav&amp;#39;ns everlasting Frame, while o&amp;#39;re the necks Thou drov&amp;#39;st of warring Angels disarraid. Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime Thee only extoll&amp;#39;d, Son of thy Fathers might, To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, Not so on Man; him through their malice fall&amp;#39;n, Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: No sooner did thy dear and onely Son Perceive thee purpos&amp;#39;d not to doom frail Man So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin&amp;#39;d, He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife Of Mercy and justice in thy face discern&amp;#39;d, Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat Second to thee, offerd himself to die For mans offence. O unexampl&amp;#39;d love, Love no where to be found less then Divine! Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name Shall be the copious matter of my Song Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. Thus they in Heav&amp;#39;n, above the starry Sphear, Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe Of this round World, whose first convex divides The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos&amp;#39;d From Chaos and th&amp;#39; inroad of Darkness old, Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off It seem&amp;#39;d, now seems a boundless Continent Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night Starless expos&amp;#39;d, and ever-threatning storms Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie; Save on that side which from the wall of Heav&amp;#39;n Though distant farr som small reflection gaines Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: Here walk&amp;#39;d the Fiend at large in spacious field. As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; But in his way lights on the barren Plaines Of Sericana, where Chineses drive With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend Walk&amp;#39;d up and down alone bent on his prey, Alone, for other Creature in this place Living or liveless to be found was none, None yet, but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like Aereal vapours flew Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin With vanity had filld the works of men: Both all things vain, and all who in vain things Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, Or happiness in this or th&amp;#39; other life; All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; All th, unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, Dissolvd on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, Till final dissolution, wander here, Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; Those argent Fields more likely habitants, Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold Betwixt th&amp;#39; Angelical and Human kinde: Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born First from the ancient World those Giants came With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: The builders next of Babel on the Plain Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: Others came single; he who to be deemd A God, leap&amp;#39;d fondly into Aetna flames, Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy Plato&amp;#39;s Elysium, leap&amp;#39;d into the Sea, Cleombrotus, and many more too long, Embryo&amp;#39;s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. Here Pilgrims roam, that stray&amp;#39;d so farr to seek In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav&amp;#39;n; And they who to be sure of Paradise Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis&amp;#39;d; They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov&amp;#39;d; And now Saint Peter at Heav&amp;#39;ns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot Of Heav&amp;#39;ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe A violent cross wind from either Coast Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry Into the devious Air; then might ye see Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft Fly o&amp;#39;re the backside of the World farr off Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown Long after, now unpeopl&amp;#39;d, and untrod; All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass&amp;#39;d, And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste His travell&amp;#39;d steps; farr distant he descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending, bands Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz, Dreaming by night under the open Skie, And waking cri&amp;#39;d, This is the Gate of Heav&amp;#39;n. Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood There alwayes, but drawn up to Heav&amp;#39;n somtimes Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow&amp;#39;d Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv&amp;#39;d, Wafted by Angels, or flew o&amp;#39;re the Lake Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. Direct against which op&amp;#39;nd from beneath, Just o&amp;#39;re the blissful seat of Paradise, A passage down to th&amp;#39; Earth, a passage wide, Wider by farr then that of after-times Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, Over the Promis&amp;#39;d Land to God so dear, By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, On high behests his Angels to and fro Pass&amp;#39;d frequent, and his eye with choice regard From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood To Beersaba, where the Holy Land Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; So wide the op&amp;#39;ning seemd, where bounds were set To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. Satan from hence now on the lower stair That scal&amp;#39;d by steps of Gold to Heav&amp;#39;n Gate Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this World at once. As when a Scout Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone All night; at last by break of chearful dawne Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some forein land First-seen, or some renown&amp;#39;d Metropolis With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. Such wonder seis&amp;#39;d, though after Heaven seen, The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis&amp;#39;d At sight of all this World beheld so faire. Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood So high above the circling Canopie Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears Andromeda farr off Atlantic Seas Beyond th&amp;#39; Horizon; then from Pole to Pole He views in bredth, and without longer pause Down right into the Worlds first Region throws His flight precipitant, and windes with ease Through the pure marble Air his oblique way Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, Like those Hesperian Gardens fam&amp;#39;d of old, Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there He stayd not to enquire: above them all The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven Allur&amp;#39;d his eye: Thither his course he bends Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute Days, months, &amp;amp; years, towards his all-chearing Lamp Turn swift thir various motions, or are turnd By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms The Univers, and to each inward part With gentle penetration, though unseen, Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: So wondrously was set his Station bright. There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Sun&amp;#39;s lucent Orbe Through his glaz&amp;#39;d Optic Tube yet never saw. The place he found beyond expression bright, Compar&amp;#39;d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; Not all parts like, but all alike informd With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, That stone, or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought, In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch Th&amp;#39; Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious and effect so rare? Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazl&amp;#39;d, farr and wide his eye commands, For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon Culminate from th&amp;#39; Aequator, as they now Shot upward still direct, whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, No where so cleer, sharp&amp;#39;nd his visual ray To objects distant farr, whereby he soon Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, The same whom John saw also in the Sun: His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar Circl&amp;#39;d his Head, nor less his Locks behind Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy&amp;#39;d He seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope To find who might direct his wandring flight To Paradise the happie seat of Man, His journies end and our beginning woe. But first he casts to change his proper shape, Which else might work him danger or delay: And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, Not of the prime, yet such as in his face Youth smil&amp;#39;d Celestial, and to every Limb Sutable grace diffus&amp;#39;d, so well he feignd; Under a Coronet his flowing haire In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore Of many a colourd plume sprinkl&amp;#39;d with Gold, His habit fit for speed succinct, and held Before his decent steps a Silver wand. He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, Admonisht by his ear, and strait was known Th&amp;#39; Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav&amp;#39;n Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes That run through all the Heav&amp;#39;ns, or down to th&amp;#39; Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, O&amp;#39;re Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; Uriel, for thou of those seav&amp;#39;n Spirits that stand In sight of God&amp;#39;s high Throne, gloriously bright, The first art wont his great authentic will Interpreter through highest Heav&amp;#39;n to bring, Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; And here art likeliest by supream decree Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye To visit oft this new Creation round; Unspeakable desire to see, and know All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, His chief delight and favour, him for whom All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; That I may find him, and with secret gaze, Or open admiration him behold On whom the great Creator hath bestowd Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; That both in him and all things, as is meet, The Universal Maker we may praise; Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss Created this new happie Race of Men To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; For neither Man nor Angel can discern Hypocrisie, the onely evil that walks Invisible, except to God alone, By his permissive will, through Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth: And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil&amp;#39;d Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav&amp;#39;n; Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule In his uprightness answer thus returnd. Fair Angel, thy desire which tends to know The works of God, thereby to glorifie The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess That reaches blame, but rather merits praise The more it seems excess, that led thee hither From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps Contented with report hear onely in heav&amp;#39;n: For wonderful indeed are all his works, Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; But what created mind can comprehend Thir number, or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, This worlds material mould, came to a heap: Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar Stood rul&amp;#39;d, stood vast infinitude confin&amp;#39;d; Till at his second bidding darkness fled, Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav&amp;#39;n Flew upward, spirited with various forms, That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; Each had his place appointed, each his course, The rest in circuit walles this Universe. Look downward on that Globe whose hither side With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light His day, which else as th&amp;#39; other Hemisphere Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide Timely interposes, and her monthly round Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav&amp;#39;n; With borrowd light her countenance triform Hence fills and empties to enlighten th&amp;#39; Earth, And in her pale dominion checks the night. That spot to which I point is Paradise, Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, Where honour due and reverence none neglects, Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, Down from th&amp;#39; Ecliptic, sped with hop&amp;#39;d success, Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheele, Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;O For that warning voice, which he who saw Th&amp;#39; Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud, Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, Came furious down to be reveng&amp;#39;d on men, Wo to the inhabitants on Earth! that now, While time was, our first-Parents had bin warnd The coming of thir secret foe, and scap&amp;#39;d Haply so scap&amp;#39;d his mortal snare; for now Satan, now first inflam&amp;#39;d with rage, came down, The Tempter ere th&amp;#39; Accuser of man-kind, To wreck on innocent frail man his loss Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, And like a devillish Engine back recoiles Upon himself; horror and doubt distract His troubl&amp;#39;d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr The Hell within him, for within him Hell He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell One step no more then from himself can fly By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie Of what he was, what is, and what must be Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, Sometimes towards Heav&amp;#39;n and the full-blazing Sun, Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, Look&amp;#39;st from thy sole Dominion like the God Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, But with no friendly voice, and add thy name O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams That bring to my remembrance from what state I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down Warring in Heav&amp;#39;n against Heav&amp;#39;ns matchless King: Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return From me, whom he created what I was In that bright eminence, and with his good Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. What could be less then to afford him praise, The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, How due! yet all his good prov&amp;#39;d ill in me, And wrought but malice; lifted up so high I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher Would set me highest, and in a moment quit The debt immense of endless gratitude, So burthensome still paying, still to ow; Forgetful what from him I still receivd, And understood not that a grateful mind By owing owes not, but still pays, at once Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? O had his powerful Destiny ordaind Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais&amp;#39;d Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power As great might have aspir&amp;#39;d, and me though mean Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great Fell not, but stand unshak&amp;#39;n, from within Or from without, to all temptations arm&amp;#39;d. Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, But Heav&amp;#39;ns free Love dealt equally to all? Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, To me alike, it deals eternal woe. Nay curs&amp;#39;d be thou; since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues. Me miserable! which way shall I flie Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatning to devour me opens wide, To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav&amp;#39;n. O then at last relent: is there no place Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? None left but by submission; and that word Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc&amp;#39;d With other promises and other vaunts Then to submit, boasting I could subdue Th&amp;#39; Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, Under what torments inwardly I groane; While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, With Diadem and Scepter high advanc&amp;#39;d The lower still I fall, onely Supream In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. But say I could repent and could obtaine By Act of Grace my former state; how soon Would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay What feign&amp;#39;d submission swore: ease would recant Vows made in pain, as violent and void. For never can true reconcilement grow Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc&amp;#39;d so deep: Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare Short intermission bought with double smart. This knows my punisher; therefore as farr From granting hee, as I from begging peace: All hope excluded thus, behold in stead Of us out-cast, exil&amp;#39;d, his new delight, Mankind created, and for him this World. So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least Divided Empire with Heav&amp;#39;ns King I hold By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. Thus while he spake, each passion dimm&amp;#39;d his face Thrice chang&amp;#39;d with pale, ire, envie and despair, Which marrd his borrow&amp;#39;d visage, and betraid Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. For heav&amp;#39;nly mindes from such distempers foule Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware, Each perturbation smooth&amp;#39;d with outward calme, Artificer of fraud; and was the first That practisd falshood under saintly shew, Deep malice to conceale, couch&amp;#39;t with revenge: Yet not anough had practisd to deceive Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu&amp;#39;d him down The way he went, and on th&amp;#39; Assyrian mount Saw him disfigur&amp;#39;d, more then could befall Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, As he suppos&amp;#39;d, all unobserv&amp;#39;d, unseen. So on he fares, and to the border comes, Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, As with a rural mound the champain head Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, Access deni&amp;#39;d; and over head up grew Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: Which to our general Sire gave prospect large Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. And higher then that Wall a circling row Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: On which the Sun more glad impress&amp;#39;d his beams Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy, able to drive All sadness but despair: now gentle gales Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare Of Arabie the blest, with such delay Well pleas&amp;#39;d they slack thir course, and many a League Chear&amp;#39;d with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas&amp;#39;d Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume, That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent From Media post to Aegypt, there fast bound. Now to th&amp;#39; ascent of that steep savage Hill Satan had journied on, pensive and slow; But further way found none, so thick entwin&amp;#39;d, As one continu&amp;#39;d brake, the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext All path of Man or Beast that past that way: One Gate there only was, and that look&amp;#39;d East On th&amp;#39; other side: which when th&amp;#39; arch-fellon saw Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, At one slight bound high over leap&amp;#39;d all bound Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve In hurdl&amp;#39;d Cotes amid the field secure, Leaps o&amp;#39;re the fence with ease into the Fould:. Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, In at the window climbs, or o&amp;#39;re the tiles; So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, The middle Tree and highest there that grew, Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death To them who liv&amp;#39;d; nor on the vertue thought Of that life-giving Plant, but only us&amp;#39;d For prospect, what well us&amp;#39;d had bin the pledge Of immortality. So little knows Any, but God alone, to value right The good before him, but perverts best things To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. Beneath him with new wonder now he views To all delight of human sense expos&amp;#39;d In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, A Heav&amp;#39;n on Earth, for blissful Paradise Of God the Garden was, by him in the East Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings, Or where the Sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; Out of the fertil ground he caus&amp;#39;d to grow All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life Our Death the Tree of knowledge grew fast by, Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. Southward through Eden went a River large, Nor chang&amp;#39;d his course, but through the shaggie hill Pass&amp;#39;d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais&amp;#39;d Upon the rapid current, which through veins Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill Waterd the Garden; thence united fell Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, Which from his darksom passage now appeers, And now divided into four main Streams, Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme And Country whereof here needs no account, But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, With mazie error under pendant shades Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote The open field, and where the unpierc&amp;#39;t shade lmbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, A happy rural seat of various view; Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true, If true, here only, and of delicious taste: Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks Grasing the tender herb, were interpos&amp;#39;d, Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap Of som irriguous Valley spred her store, Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves Of coole recess, o&amp;#39;re which the mantling vine Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, Her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance Led on th&amp;#39; Eternal Spring. Not that faire field Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flours Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove Of Daphne by Orontes, and th&amp;#39; inspir&amp;#39;d Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham, Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove, Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea&amp;#39;s eye; Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard, Mount Amara, though this by som suppos&amp;#39;d True Paradise under the Ethiop Line By Nilus head, enclosd with shining Rock, A whole days journy high, but wide remote From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend Saw undelighted all delight, all kind Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, Godlike erect, with native Honour clad In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine The image of thir glorious Maker shon, Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, Severe but in true filial freedom plac&amp;#39;t; Whence true autoritie in men; though both Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; For contemplation hee and valour formd, For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, Hee for God only, shee for God in him: His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar&amp;#39;d Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: Shee as a vail down to the slender waste Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav&amp;#39;d As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli&amp;#39;d Subjection, but requir&amp;#39;d with gentle sway, And by her yielded, by him best receivd, Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, And sweet reluctant amorous delay. Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame Of natures works, honor dishonorable, Sin-bred, how have ye troubl&amp;#39;d all mankind With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, And banisht from mans life his happiest life, Simplicitie and spotless innocence. So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair That ever since in loves imbraces met, Adam the goodliest man of men since borne His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. Under a tuft of shade that on a green Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side They sat them down, and after no more toil Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic&amp;#39;d To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, Alone as they. About them frisking playd All Beasts of th&amp;#39; Earth, since wilde, and of all chase In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw Dandl&amp;#39;d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards, Gambold before them, th&amp;#39; unwieldy Elephant To make them mirth us&amp;#39;d all his might, and wreathd His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine His breaded train, and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun Declin&amp;#39;d was hasting now with prone carreer To th&amp;#39; Ocean Iles, and in th&amp;#39; ascending Scale Of Heav&amp;#39;n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, Into our room of bliss thus high advanc&amp;#39;t Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, Not Spirits, yet to heav&amp;#39;nly Spirits bright Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder, and could love, so lively shines In them Divine resemblance, and such grace The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh Your change approaches, when all these delights Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; Happie, but for so happie ill secur&amp;#39;d Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav&amp;#39;n Ill fenc&amp;#39;t for Heav&amp;#39;n to keep out such a foe As now is enterd; yet no purpos&amp;#39;d foe To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, And mutual amitie so streight, so close, That I with you must dwell, or you with me Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfold, To entertain you two, her widest Gates, And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, Not like these narrow limits, to receive ass Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. And should I at your harmless innocence Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg&amp;#39;d, By conquering this new World, compels me now To do what else though damnd I should abhorre. So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, The Tyrants plea, excus&amp;#39;d his devilish deeds. Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree Down he alights among the sportful Herd Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, Now other, as thir shape servd best his end Neerer to view his prey, and unespi&amp;#39;d To mark what of thir state he more might learn By word or action markt: about them round A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, Then as a Tyger, who by chance hath spi&amp;#39;d In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play, Strait couches close, then rising changes oft His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground Whence rushing he might surest seize them both Grip&amp;#39;t in each paw: When Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech, Turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, Dearer thy self then all; needs must the power That made us, and for us this ample World Be infinitly good, and of his good As liberal and free as infinite, That rais&amp;#39;d us from the dust and plac&amp;#39;t us here In all this happiness, who at his hand Have nothing merited, nor can performe Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires From us no other service then to keep This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees In Paradise that bear delicious fruit So various, not to taste that onely Tree Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst God hath pronounc&amp;#39;t it death to taste that Tree, The only sign of our obedience left Among so many signes of power and rule Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv&amp;#39;n Over all other Creatures that possess Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard One easie prohibition, who enjoy Free leave so large to all things else, and choice Unlimited of manifold delights: But let us ever praise him, and extoll His bountie, following our delightful task To prune these growing Plants, and tend these Flours, Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. To whom thus Eve repli&amp;#39;d. O thou for whom And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, And without whom am to no end, my Guide And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. For wee to him indeed all praises owe, And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee Praeeminent by so much odds, while thou Like consort to thy self canst no where find. That day I oft remember, when from sleep I first awak&amp;#39;t, and found my self repos&amp;#39;d Under a shade of flours, much wondring where And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issu&amp;#39;d from a Cave and spread Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov&amp;#39;d Pure as th&amp;#39; expanse of Heav&amp;#39;n; I thither went With unexperienc&amp;#39;t thought, and laid me downe On the green bank, to look into the cleer Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. As I bent down to look, just opposite, A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd Bending to look on me, I started back, It started back, but pleas&amp;#39;d I soon returnd, Pleas&amp;#39;d it returnd as soon with answering looks Of sympathie and love; there I had fixt Mine eyes till now, and pin&amp;#39;d with vain desire, Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest, What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, With thee it came and goes: but follow me, And I will bring thee where no shadow staies Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call&amp;#39;d Mother of human Race: what could I doe, But follow strait, invisibly thus led? Till I espi&amp;#39;d thee, fair indeed and tall, Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, Thou following cryd&amp;#39;st aloud, Return faire Eve, Whom fli&amp;#39;st thou? whom thou fli&amp;#39;st, of him thou art, His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart Substantial Life, to have thee by my side Henceforth an individual solace dear; Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim My other half: with that thy gentle hand Seisd mine, I yielded, and from that time see How beauty is excelld by manly grace And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. So spake our general Mother, and with eyes Of conjugal attraction unreprov&amp;#39;d, And meek surrender, half imbracing leand On our first Father, half her swelling Breast Naked met his under the flowing Gold Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms Smil&amp;#39;d with superior Love, as Jupiter On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds That shed May Flowers; and press&amp;#39;d her Matron lip With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne Ey&amp;#39;d them askance, and to himself thus plaind. Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two Imparadis&amp;#39;t in one anothers arms The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, Among our other torments not the least, Still unfulfill&amp;#39;d with pain of longing pines; Yet let me not forget what I have gain&amp;#39;d From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call&amp;#39;d, Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd&amp;#39;n? Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord Envie them that? can it be sin to know, Can it be death? and do they onely stand By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? O fair foundation laid whereon to build Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds With more desire to know, and to reject Envious commands, invented with designe To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? But first with narrow search I must walk round This Garden, and no corner leave unspi&amp;#39;d; A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandring Spirit of Heav&amp;#39;n, by Fountain side, Or in thick shade retir&amp;#39;d, from him to draw What further would be learnt. Live while ye may, Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. So saying, his proud step he scornful turn&amp;#39;d, But with sly circumspection, and began Through wood, through waste, o&amp;#39;re hill, o&amp;#39;re dale his roam. Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav&amp;#39;n With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun Slowly descended, and with right aspect Against the eastern Gate of Paradise Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock Of Alablaster, pil&amp;#39;d up to the Clouds, Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat Chief of th&amp;#39; Angelic Guards, awaiting night; About him exercis&amp;#39;d Heroic Games Th&amp;#39; unarmed Youth of Heav&amp;#39;n, but nigh at hand Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares, Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir&amp;#39;d Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner From what point of his Compass to beware Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. Gabriel, to thee thy course by Lot hath giv&amp;#39;n Charge and strict watch that to this happie Place No evil thing approach or enter in; This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare A Spirit, zealous, as he seem&amp;#39;d, to know More of th&amp;#39; Almighties works, and chiefly Man Gods latest Image: I describ&amp;#39;d his way Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; But in the Mount that lies from Eden North, Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks Alien from Heav&amp;#39;n, with passions foul obscur&amp;#39;d: Mine eye pursu&amp;#39;d him still, but under shade Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew I fear, hath ventur&amp;#39;d from the deep, to raise New troubles; him thy care must be to find. To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass The vigilance here plac&amp;#39;t, but such as come Well known from Heav&amp;#39;n; and since Meridian hour No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. But if within the circuit of these walks, In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom Thou tellst, by morrow dawning I shall know. So promis&amp;#39;d hee, and Uriel to his charge Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall&amp;#39;n Beneath th&amp;#39; Azores; whither the prime Orb, Incredible how swift, had thither rowl&amp;#39;d Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth By shorter flight to th&amp;#39; East, had left him there Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; She all night long her amorous descant sung; Silence was pleas&amp;#39;d: now glow&amp;#39;d the Firmament With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon Rising in clouded Majestie, at length Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, And o&amp;#39;re the dark her Silver Mantle threw. When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th&amp;#39; hour Of night, and all things now retir&amp;#39;d to rest Mind us of like repose, since God hath set Labour and rest, as day and night to men Successive, and the timely dew of sleep Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, And the regard of Heav&amp;#39;n on all his waies; While other Animals unactive range, And of thir doings God takes no account. To morrow ere fresh Morning streak the East With first approach of light, we must be ris&amp;#39;n, And at our pleasant labour, to reform Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, That mock our scant manuring, and require More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd. My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst Unargu&amp;#39;d I obey; so God ordains, God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. With thee conversing I forget all time, All seasons and thir change, all please alike. Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun When first on this delightful Land he spreads His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth After soft showers; and sweet the coming on Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, And these the Gemms of Heav&amp;#39;n, her starrie train: But neither breath of Morn when she ascends With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, Nor grateful Eevning mild, nor silent Night With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? To whom our general Ancestor repli&amp;#39;d. Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land In order, though to Nations yet unborn, Ministring light prepar&amp;#39;d, they set and rise; Least total darkness should by Night regaine Her old possession, and extinguish life In Nature and all things, which these soft fires Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate Of various influence foment and warme, Temper or nourish, or in part shed down Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow On Earth, made hereby apter to receive Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, That heav&amp;#39;n would want spectators, God want praise; Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. All these with ceasless praise his works behold Both day and night: how often from the steep Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard Celestial voices to the midnight air, Sole, or responsive each to others note Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk With Heav&amp;#39;nly touch of instrumental sounds In full harmonic number joind, thir songs Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass&amp;#39;d On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place Chos&amp;#39;n by the sovran Planter, when he fram&amp;#39;d All things to mans delightful use; the roofe Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub Fenc&amp;#39;d up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin Rear&amp;#39;d high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay Broiderd the ground, more colour&amp;#39;d then with stone Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; Such was thir awe of Man. In shadie Bower More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs Espoused Eve deckt first her nuptial Bed, And heav&amp;#39;nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, What day the genial Angel to our Sire Brought her in naked beauty more adorn&amp;#39;d, More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like In sad event, when to the unwiser Son Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar&amp;#39;d Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng&amp;#39;d On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv&amp;#39;d, both stood Both turnd, and under op&amp;#39;n Skie ador&amp;#39;d The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth and Heav&amp;#39;n Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe And starrie Pole: Thou also mad&amp;#39;st the Night, Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, Which we in our appointed work imployd Have finisht happie in our mutual help And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss Ordaind by thee, and this delicious place For us too large, where thy abundance wants Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. But thou hast promis&amp;#39;d from us two a Race To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. This said unanimous, and other Rites Observing none, but adoration pure Which God likes best, into thir inmost bowre Handed they went; and eas&amp;#39;d the putting off These troublesom disguises which wee wear, Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites Mysterious of connubial Love refus&amp;#39;d: Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk Of puritie and place and innocence, Defaming as impure what God declares Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain But our destroyer, foe to God and Man? Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, In Paradise of all things common else. By thee adulterous lust was driv&amp;#39;n from men Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee Founded in Reason, Loyal, just, and Pure, Relations dear, and all the Charities Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, Whose bed is undefil&amp;#39;d and chaste pronounc&amp;#39;t, Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us&amp;#39;d. Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, Or Serenate, which the starv&amp;#39;d Lover sings To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair&amp;#39;d. Sleep on Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek No happier state, and know to know no more. Now had night measur&amp;#39;d with her shaddowie Cone Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim Forth issuing at th&amp;#39; accustomd hour stood armd To thir night watches in warlike Parade, When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed Search through this Garden, leave unsearcht no nook, But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. This Eevning from the Sun&amp;#39;s decline arriv&amp;#39;d Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap&amp;#39;d The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. So saying, on he led his radiant Files, Daz&amp;#39;ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct In search of whom they sought: him there they found Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve; Assaying by his Devilish art to reach The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint Th&amp;#39; animal Spirits that from pure blood arise Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, Vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear Touch&amp;#39;d lightly; for no falshood can endure Touch of Celestial temper, but returns Of force to its own likeness: up he starts Discoverd and surpriz&amp;#39;d. As when a spark Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine With sudden blaze diffus&amp;#39;d, inflames the Aire: So started up in his own shape the Fiend. Back stept those two faire Angels half amaz&amp;#39;d So sudden to behold the grieslie King; Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg&amp;#39;d to Hell Com&amp;#39;st thou, escap&amp;#39;d thy prison, and transform&amp;#39;d, Why satst thou like an enemie in waite Here watching at the head of these that sleep? Know ye not then said Satan, fill&amp;#39;d with scorn, Know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, Why ask ye, and superfluous begin Your message, like to end as much in vain? To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, Or undiminisht brightness, to be known As when thou stoodst in Heav&amp;#39;n upright and pure; That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, Departed from thee, and thou resembl&amp;#39;st now Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep This place inviolable, and these from harm. So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke Severe in youthful beautie, added grace Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, And felt how awful goodness is, and saw Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin&amp;#39;d His loss; but chiefly to find here observd His lustre visibly impar&amp;#39;d; yet seemd Undaunted. If I must contend, said he, Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold, Will save us trial what the least can doe Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. The Fiend repli&amp;#39;d not, overcome with rage; But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie He held it vain; awe from above had quelld His heart, not else dismai&amp;#39;d. Now drew they nigh The western Point, where those half-rounding guard just met, and closing stood in squadron joind Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, And with them comes a third of Regal port, But faded splendor wan; who by his gate And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, Not likely to part hence without contest; Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. He scarce had ended, when those two approachd And brief related whom they brought, where found, How busied, in what form and posture coucht. To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. Why hast thou, Satan broke the bounds prescrib&amp;#39;d To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge Of others, who approve not to transgress By thy example, but have power and right To question thy bold entrance on this place; Imploi&amp;#39;d it seems to violate sleep, and those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? To whom thus Satan, with contemptuous brow. Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav&amp;#39;n th&amp;#39; esteem of wise, And such I held thee; but this question askt Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain? Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, And boldly venture to whatever place Farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change Torment with ease, and soonest recompence Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; To thee no reason; who knowst only good, But evil hast not tri&amp;#39;d: and wilt object His will who bound us? let him surer barr His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. The rest is true, they found me where they say; But that implies not violence or harme. Thus he in scorn.The warlike Angel mov&amp;#39;d, Disdainfully half smiling thus repli&amp;#39;d. O loss of one in Heav&amp;#39;n to judge of wise, Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, And now returns him from his prison scap&amp;#39;t, Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither Unlicenc&amp;#39;t from his bounds in Hell prescrib&amp;#39;d; So wise he judges it to fly from pain However, and to scape his punishment. So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, Which thou incurr&amp;#39;st by flying, meet thy flight Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain Can equal anger infinite provok&amp;#39;t. But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, The first in flight from pain, had&amp;#39;st thou alledg&amp;#39;d To thy deserted host this cause of flight, Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide Thy blasting volied Thunder made all speed And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. But still thy words at random, as before, Argue thy inexperience what behooves From hard assaies and ill successes past A faithful Leader, not to hazard all Through wayes of danger by himself untri&amp;#39;d. I therefore, I alone first undertook To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie This new created World, whereof in Hell Fame is not silent, here in hope to find Better abode, and my afflicted Powers To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; Though for possession put to try once more What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord High up in Heav&amp;#39;n, with songs to hymne his Throne, And practis&amp;#39;d distances to cringe, not fight. To whom the warriour Angel, soon repli&amp;#39;d. To say and strait unsay, pretending first Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, Argues no Leader but a lyar trac&amp;#39;t, Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, O sacred name of faithfulness profan&amp;#39;d! Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; Was this your discipline and faith ingag&amp;#39;d, Your military obedience, to dissolve Allegeance to th&amp;#39; acknowldg&amp;#39;d Power supream? And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem Patron of liberty, who more then thou Once fawn&amp;#39;d, and cring&amp;#39;d, and servilly ador&amp;#39;d Heav&amp;#39;ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, Back to th&amp;#39; infernal pit I drag thee chaind, And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. So threatn&amp;#39;d hee, but Satan to no threats Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli&amp;#39;d. Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, Us&amp;#39;d to the yoak, draw&amp;#39;st his triumphant wheels In progress through the rode of Heav&amp;#39;n Star-pav&amp;#39;d. While thus he spake, th&amp;#39; Angelic Squadron bright Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round With ported Spears, as thick as when a field Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves Prove chaff. On th&amp;#39; other side Satan allarm&amp;#39;d Collecting all his might dilated stood, Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov&amp;#39;d: His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest Sat horror Plum&amp;#39;d; nor wanted in his graspe What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds Might have ensu&amp;#39;d, nor onely Paradise In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope Of Heav&amp;#39;n perhaps, or all the Elements At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne With violence of this conflict, had not soon Th&amp;#39; Eternal to prevent such horrid fray Hung forth in Heav&amp;#39;n his golden Scales, yet seen Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe, Wherein all things created first he weighd, The pendulous round Earth with ballanc&amp;#39;t Aire In counterpoise, now ponders all events, Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights The sequel each of parting and of fight; The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, Neither our own but giv&amp;#39;n; what follie then To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more Then Heav&amp;#39;n permits, nor mine, though doubld now To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign Where thou art weigh&amp;#39;d, and shown how light, how weak, If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,

AwakeMy fairest, my espous&amp;#39;d, my latest found,Heav&amp;#39;ns last best gift, my ever new delight,Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh fieldCalls us, we lose the prime, to mark how springOur tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,What drops the Myrrhe, and what the balmie Reed,How Nature paints her colours, how the BeeSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.Such whispering wak&amp;#39;d her, but with startl&amp;#39;d eyeOn Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake.O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I seeThy face, and Morn return&amp;#39;d, for I this Night,Such night till this I never pass&amp;#39;d, have dream&amp;#39;d,If dream&amp;#39;d, not as I oft am wont, of thee,Works of day pass&amp;#39;t, or morrows next designe,But of offence and trouble, which my mindKnew never till this irksom night; methoughtClose at mine ear one call&amp;#39;d me forth to walkWith gentle voice, I though it thine; it said,Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time,The cool, the silent, save where silence yieldsTo the night-warbling Bird, that now awakeTunes sweetest his love-labor&amp;#39;d song; now reignesFull Orb&amp;#39;d the Moon, and with more pleasing lightShadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,If none regard; Heav&amp;#39;n wakes with all his eyes,Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,In whose sight all things joy, with ravishmentAttracted by thy beauty still to gaze.I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;To find thee I directed then my walk;And on, methought, alone I pass&amp;#39;d through waysThat brought me on a sudden to the TreeOf interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem&amp;#39;d,Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:And as I wondring lookt, beside it stoodOne shap&amp;#39;d and wing&amp;#39;d like one of those from Heav&amp;#39;nBy us oft seen; his dewie locks distill&amp;#39;dAmbrosia; on that Tree he also gaz&amp;#39;d;And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg&amp;#39;d,Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis&amp;#39;d?Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?Forbid who will, none shall from me withholdLonger thy offerd good, why else set here?This said he paus&amp;#39;d not, but with ventrous ArmeHe pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil&amp;#39;dAt such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:But he thus overjoy&amp;#39;d, O Fruit Divine,Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,Forbidd&amp;#39;n here, it seems, as onely fitFor God&amp;#39;s, yet able to make Gods of Men:And why not Gods of Men, since good, the moreCommunicated, more abundant growes,The Author not impair&amp;#39;d, but honourd more?Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve,Partake thou also; happie though thou art,Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:Taste this, and be henceforth among the GodsThy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimesAscend to Heav&amp;#39;n, by merit thine, and seeWhat life the Gods live there, and such live thou.So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,Even to my mouth of that same fruit held partWhich he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smellSo quick&amp;#39;nd appetite, that I, methought,Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the CloudsWith him I flew, and underneath beheldThe Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wideAnd various: wondring at my flight and changeTo this high exaltation; suddenlyMy Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak&amp;#39;dTo find this but a dream! Thus Eve her NightRelated, and thus Adam answerd sad.Best image of my self and dearer half,The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleepAffects me equally; nor can I likeThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,Created pure. But know that in the SouleAre many lesser Faculties that serveReason as chief; among these Fansie nextHer office holds; of all external things,Which the five watchful Senses represent,She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, framesAll what we affirm or what deny, and callOur knowledge or opinion; then retiresInto her private Cell when Nature rests,Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakesTo imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.Som such resemblances methinks I findOf our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,But with addition strange; yet be not sad.Evil into the mind of God or ManMay come or go, so unapprov&amp;#39;d, and leaveNo spot or blame behind: Which gives me hopeThat what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,Waking thou never wilt consent to do.Be not disheart&amp;#39;nd then, nor cloud those looksThat wont to be more chearful and sereneThen when fair Morning first smiles on the World,And let us to our fresh imployments riseAmong the Groves, the Fountains, and the FloursThat open now thir choicest bosom&amp;#39;d smellsReservd from night, and kept for thee in store.So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,But silently a gentle tear let fallFrom either eye, and wip&amp;#39;d them with her haire;Two other precious drops that ready stood,Each in thir Chrystal sluce, hee ere they fellKiss&amp;#39;d as the gracious signs of sweet remorseAnd pious awe, that feard to have offended.So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.But first from under shadie arborous roof,Soon as they forth were come to open sightOf day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risenWith wheels yet hov&amp;#39;ring o&amp;#39;re the Ocean brim,Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,Discovering in wide Lantskip all the EastOf Paradise and Edens happie Plains,Lowly they bow&amp;#39;d adoring, and beganThir Orisons, each Morning duly paidIn various style, for neither various styleNor holy rapture wanted they to praiseThir Maker, in fit strains pronounc&amp;#39;t or sungUnmeditated, such prompt eloquenceFlowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,More tuneable then needed Lute or HarpTo add more sweetness, and they thus began.These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,Almightie, thine this universal Frame,Thus wondrous fair;

and wave your tops, ye Pines,With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,That singing up to Heaven gate ascend,Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walkThe Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shadeMade vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.Hail universal Lord, be bounteous stillTo give us onely good; and if the nightHave gathered aught of evil or conceald,Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.So pray&amp;#39;d they innocent, and to thir thoughtsFirm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.On to thir mornings rural work they hasteAmong sweet dewes and flours; where any rowOf Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farrThir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to checkFruitless imbraces: or they led the VineTo wed her Elm; she spous&amp;#39;d about him twinesHer mariageable arms, and with her bringsHer dowr th&amp;#39;

Therefore what he gives(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in partSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be foundNo ingrateful food; and food alike those pureIntelligential substances requireAs doth your Rational; and both containWithin them every lower facultieOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,And corporeal to incorporeal turn.For know, whatever was created, needsTo be sustaind and fed; of ElementsThe grosser feeds the purer, Earth the Sea,Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those FiresEthereal, and as lowest first the Moon;Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg&amp;#39;dVapours not yet into her substance turnd.Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhaleFrom her moist Continent to higher Orbes.The Sun that light imparts to all, receivesFrom all his alimental recompenceIn humid exhalations, and at EvenSups with the Ocean: though in Heav&amp;#39;n the TreesOf life ambrosial frutage bear, and vinesYield Nectar, though from off the boughs each MornWe brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the groundCover&amp;#39;d with pearly grain: yet God hath hereVaried his bounty so with new delights,As may compare with Heaven; and to tasteThink not I shall be nice. So down they sat,And to thir viands fell, nor seeminglyThe Angel, nor in mist, the common glossOf Theologians, but with keen dispatchOf real hunger, and concoctive heate.To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpiresThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fireOf sooty coal the Empiric AlchimistCan turn, or holds it possible to turnMetals of drossiest Ore to perfet GoldAs from the Mine.

Son of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth,Attend: That thou are happie, owe to God;That thou continu&amp;#39;st such, owe to thy self,That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.This was that caution giv&amp;#39;n thee; be advis&amp;#39;d.God made thee perfet, not immutable;And good he made thee, but to persevereHe left it in thy power, ordaind thy willBy nature free, not over-rul&amp;#39;d by FateInextricable, or strict necessity;Our voluntarie service he requires,Not our necessitated, such with himFindes no acceptance, nor can find, for howCan hearts, not free, be tri&amp;#39;d whether they serveWilling or no, who will but what they mustBy Destinie, and can no other choose?My self and all th&amp;#39; Angelic Host that standIn sight of God enthron&amp;#39;d, our happie stateHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;On other surety none; freely we serve,Because wee freely love, as in our willTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:And som are fall&amp;#39;n, to disobedience fall&amp;#39;n,And so from Heav&amp;#39;n to deepest Hell; O fallFrom what high state of bliss into what woe!To whom our great Progenitor. Thy wordsAttentive, and with more delighted eare,Divine instructer, I have heard, then whenCherubic Songs by night from neighbouring HillsAereal Music send: nor knew I notTo be both will and deed created free;Yet that we never shall forget to loveOur maker, and obey him whose commandSingle, is yet so just, my constant thoughtsAssur&amp;#39;d me, and still assure: though what thou tellstHath past in Heav&amp;#39;n, som doubt within me move,But more desire to hear, if thou consent,The full relation, which must needs be strange,Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;And we have yet large day, for scarce the SunHath finisht half his journey, and scarce beginsHis other half in the great Zone of Heav&amp;#39;n.Thus Adam made request, and RaphaelAfter short pause assenting, thus began.High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,Sad task and hard, for how shall I relateTo human sense th&amp;#39; invisible exploitsOf warring Spirits; how without remorseThe ruin of so many glorious onceAnd perfet while they stood; how last unfouldThe secrets of another world, perhapsNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy goodThis is dispenc&amp;#39;t, and what surmounts the reachOf human sense, I shall delineate so,By lik&amp;#39;ning spiritual to corporal forms,As may express them best, though what if EarthBe but the shaddow of Heav&amp;#39;n, and things thereinEach to other like, more then on earth is thought?As yet this world was not, and Chaos wildeReignd where these Heav&amp;#39;ns now rowl, where Earth now restsUpon her Center pois&amp;#39;d, when on a day(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli&amp;#39;dTo motion, measures all things durableBy present, past, and future) on such dayAs Heav&amp;#39;ns great Year brings forth, th&amp;#39; Empyreal HostOf Angels by Imperial summons call&amp;#39;d,Innumerable before th&amp;#39; Almighties ThroneForthwith from all the ends of Heav&amp;#39;n appeerdUnder thir Hierarchs in orders brightTen thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc&amp;#39;d,Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and ReareStreame in the Aire, and for distinction serveOf Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz&amp;#39;dHoly Memorials, acts of Zeale and LoveRecorded eminent. Thus when in OrbsOf circuit inexpressible they stood,Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,By whom in bliss imbosom&amp;#39;d sat the Son,Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose topBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,Hear my Decree, which unrevok&amp;#39;t shall stand.This day I have begot whom I declareMy onely Son, and on this holy HillHim have anointed, whom ye now beholdAt my right hand; your Head I him appoint;And by my Self have sworn to him shall bowAll knees in Heav&amp;#39;n, and shall confess him Lord:Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abideUnited as one individual SouleFor ever happie: him who disobeyesMee disobeyes, breaks union, and that dayCast out from God and blessed vision, fallsInto utter darkness, deep ingulft, his placeOrdaind without redemption, without end.So spake th&amp;#39; Omnipotent, and with his wordsAll seemd well pleas&amp;#39;d, all seem&amp;#39;d, but were not all.That day, as other solemn dayes, they spentIn song and dance about the sacred Hill,Mystical dance, which yonder starrie SpheareOf Planets and of fixt in all her WheelesResembles nearest, mazes intricate,Eccentric, intervolv&amp;#39;d, yet regularThen most, when most irregular they seem,And in thir motions harmonie DivineSo smooths her charming tones, that Gods own earListens delighted. Eevning now approach&amp;#39;d(For wee have also our Eevning and our Morn,Wee ours for change delectable, not need)Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turnDesirous; all in Circles as they stood,Tables are set, and on a sudden pil&amp;#39;dWith Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flowsIn Pearl, in Diamond, and massie GoldFruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav&amp;#39;n.On flours repos&amp;#39;d, and with fresh flourets crownd,They eate, they drink, and in communion sweetQuaff immortalitie and joy, secureOf surfet where full measure onely boundsExcess, before th&amp;#39; all bounteous King, who showrdWith copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal&amp;#39;dFrom that high mount of God, whence light &amp;amp; shadeSpring both, the face of brightest Heav&amp;#39;n had changdTo grateful Twilight (for Night comes not thereIn darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos&amp;#39;dAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,Wide over all the Plain, and wider farrThen all this globous Earth in Plain out spred,(Such are the Courts of God) Th&amp;#39; Angelic throngDisperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extendBy living Streams among the Trees of Life,Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,Celestial Tabernacles, where they sleptFannd with cool Winds, save those who in thir courseMelodious Hymns about the sovran ThroneAlternate all night long: but not so wak&amp;#39;dSatan, so call him now, his former nameIs heard no more in Heav&amp;#39;n; he of the first,If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,In favour and in praeeminence, yet fraughtWith envie against the Son of God, that dayHonourd by his great Father, and proclaimdMessiah King anointed, could not beareThrough pride that sight, &amp;amp; thought himself impaird.Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houreFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv&amp;#39;dWith all his Legions to dislodge, and leaveUnworshipt, unobey&amp;#39;d the Throne supreamContemptuous, and his next subordinateAwak&amp;#39;ning, thus to him in secret spake.Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can closeThy eye-lids: and remembrest what DecreeOf yesterday, so late hath past the lipsOf Heav&amp;#39;ns Almightie.

But to grant it thee unjust,That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:Thy self though great and glorious dost thou count,Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,Equal to him begotten Son, by whomAs by his Word the mighty Father madeAll things, ev&amp;#39;n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav&amp;#39;nBy him created in thir bright degrees,Crownd them with Glory, and to thir Glory nam&amp;#39;dThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur&amp;#39;d,But more illustrious made, since he the HeadOne of our number thus reduc&amp;#39;t becomes,His Laws our Laws, all honour to him doneReturns our own. Cease then this impious rage,And tempt not these; but hast&amp;#39;n to appeaseTh&amp;#39; incensed Father, and th&amp;#39; incensed Son,While Pardon may be found in time besought.So spake the fervent Angel, but his zealeNone seconded, as out of season judg&amp;#39;d,Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic&amp;#39;dTh&amp;#39; Apostat, and more haughty thus repli&amp;#39;d.That were formd then saist thou? and the workOf secondarie hands, by task transferdFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who sawWhen this creation was? rememberst thouThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?We know no time when we were not as now;Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais&amp;#39;dBy our own quick&amp;#39;ning power, when fatal courseHad circl&amp;#39;d his full Orbe, the birth matureOf this our native Heav&amp;#39;n, Ethereal Sons.Our puissance is our own, our own right handShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to tryWho is our equal: then thou shalt beholdWhether by supplication we intendAddress, and to begirt th&amp;#39; Almighty ThroneBeseeching or besieging. This report,These tidings carrie to th&amp;#39; anointed King;And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.He said, and as the sound of waters deepHoarce murmur echo&amp;#39;d to his words applauseThrough the infinite Host, nor less for thatThe flaming Seraph fearless, though aloneEncompass&amp;#39;d round with foes, thus answerd bold.O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,Forsak&amp;#39;n of all good; I see thy fallDetermind, and thy hapless crew involv&amp;#39;dIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spredBoth of thy crime and punishment: henceforthNot more be troubl&amp;#39;d how to quit the yokeOf Gods Messiah; those indulgent LawsWill not be now voutsaf&amp;#39;t, other DecreesAgainst thee are gon forth without recall;That Golden Scepter which thou didst rejectIs now an Iron Rod to bruise and breakThy disobedience. Well thou didst advise,Yet not for thy advise or threats I flyThese wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauthImpendent, raging into sudden flameDistinguish not: for soon expect to feelHis Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.Then who created thee lamenting learne,When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found,Among the faithless, faithful only hee;Among innumerable false, unmov&amp;#39;d,Unshak&amp;#39;n, unseduc&amp;#39;d, unterrifi&amp;#39;dHis Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;Nor number, nor example with him wroughtTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mindThough single. From amidst them forth he pass&amp;#39;d,Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteindSuperior, nor of violence fear&amp;#39;d aught;And with retorted scorn his back he turn&amp;#39;dOn those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom&amp;#39;d.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursu\&amp;#39;d Through Heav\&amp;#39;ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn, Wak\&amp;#39;t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand Unbarr\&amp;#39;d the gates of Light. There is a Cave Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne, Where light and darkness in perpetual round Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav\&amp;#39;n Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night; Light issues forth, and at the other dore Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre To veile the Heav\&amp;#39;n, though darkness there might well Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn Such as in highest Heav\&amp;#39;n, arrayd in Gold Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night, Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright, Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: Warr he perceav\&amp;#39;d, warr in procinct, and found Already known what he for news had thought To have reported: gladly then he mixt Among those friendly Powers who him receav\&amp;#39;d With joy and acclamations loud, that one That of so many Myriads fall\&amp;#39;n, yet one Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill They led him high applauded, and present Before the seat supream; from whence a voice From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard. Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought The better fight, who single hast maintaind Against revolted multitudes the Cause Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes; And for the testimonie of Truth hast born Universal reproach, far worse to beare Then violence: for this was all thy care To stand approv\&amp;#39;d in sight of God, though Worlds Judg\&amp;#39;d thee perverse: the easier conquest now Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, Back on thy foes more glorious to return Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue By force, who reason for thir Law refuse, Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns. Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince, And thou in Military prowess next Gabriel, lead forth to Battel these my Sons Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints By Thousands and by Millions rang\&amp;#39;d for fight; Equal in number to that Godless crew Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav\&amp;#39;n Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss, Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide His fiery Chaos to receave thir fall. So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe Of wrauth awak\&amp;#39;t: nor with less dread the loud Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow: At which command the Powers Militant, That stood for Heav\&amp;#39;n, in mighty Quadrate joyn&amp;quot;d Of Union irresistible, mov\&amp;#39;d on In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound Of instrumental Harmonie that breath\&amp;#39;d Heroic Ardor to advent\&amp;#39;rous deeds Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause Of God and his Messiah. On they move Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill, Nor streit\&amp;#39;ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore Thir nimble tread, as when the total kind Of Birds in orderly array on wing Came summond over Eden to receive Thir names of thee; so over many a tract Of Heav\&amp;#39;n they march\&amp;#39;d, and many a Province wide Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last Farr in th\&amp;#39; Horizon to the North appeer\&amp;#39;d From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht In battailous aspect, and neerer view Bristl\&amp;#39;d with upright beams innumerable Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng\&amp;#39;d, and Shields Various, with boastful Argument portraid, The banded Powers of Satan hasting on With furious expedition; for they weend That self same day by fight, or by surprize To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne To set the envier of his State, the proud Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov\&amp;#39;d fond and vain In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd At first, that Angel should with Angel warr, And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet So oft in Festivals of joy and love Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire Hymning th\&amp;#39; Eternal Father: but the shout Of Battel now began, and rushing sound Of onset ended soon each milder thought. High in the midst exalted as a God Th\&amp;#39; Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos\&amp;#39;d With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now \&amp;#39;Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, A dreadful intervall, and Front to Front Presented stood in terrible array Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn,d, Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc\&amp;#39;t, Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; Abdiel that sight endur\&amp;#39;d not, where he stood Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, And thus his own undaunted heart explores. O Heav\&amp;#39;n! that such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain, where faith and realtie Remain not; wherfore should not strength and might There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? His puissance, trusting in th\&amp;#39; Almightie\&amp;#39;s aide, I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri\&amp;#39;d Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, That he who in debate of Truth hath won, Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike Victor; though brutish that contest and foule, When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so Most reason is that Reason overcome. So pondering, and from his armed Peers Forth stepping opposite, half way he met His daring foe, at this prevention more Incens\&amp;#39;t, and thus securely him defi\&amp;#39;d. Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht The highth of thy aspiring unoppos\&amp;#39;d, The Throne of God unguarded, and his side Abandond at the terror of thy Power Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain Against th\&amp;#39; Omnipotent to rise in Arms; Who out of smallest things could without end Have rais\&amp;#39;d incessant Armies to defeat Thy folly; or with solitarie hand Reaching beyond all limit at one blow Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then To thee not visible, when I alone Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late How few somtimes may know, when thousands err. Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance Thus answerd. Ill for thee, but in wisht houre Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst From flight, seditious Angel, to receave Thy merited reward, the first assay Of this right hand provok\&amp;#39;t, since first that tongue Inspir\&amp;#39;d with contradiction durst oppose A third part of the Gods, in Synod met Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel Vigour Divine within them, can allow Omnipotence to none. But well thou comst Before thy fellows, ambitious to win From me som Plume, that thy success may show Destruction to the rest: this pause between (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; At first I thought that Libertie and Heav\&amp;#39;n To heav\&amp;#39;nly Soules had bin all one; but now I see that most through sloth had rather serve, Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; Such hast thou arm\&amp;#39;d, the Ministrelsie of Heav\&amp;#39;n, Servilitie with freedom to contend, As both thir deeds compar\&amp;#39;d this day shall prove. To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli\&amp;#39;d. Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find Of erring, from the path of truth remote: Unjustly thou deprav\&amp;#39;st it with the name Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains, Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, When he who rules is worthiest, and excells Them whom he governs. This is servitude, To serve th\&amp;#39; unwise, or him who hath rebelld Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall\&amp;#39;d; Yet leudly dar\&amp;#39;st our ministring upbraid. Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve In Heav\&amp;#39;n God ever blest, and his Divine Behests obey, worthiest to be obey\&amp;#39;d, Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight, Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth Winds under ground or waters forcing way Sidelong, had push\&amp;#39;t a Mountain from his seat Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis\&amp;#39;d The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see Thus foil\&amp;#39;d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, Presage of Victorie and fierce desire Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound Th\&amp;#39; Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn\&amp;#39;d The horrid shock: now storming furie rose, And clamour such as heard in Heav\&amp;#39;n till now Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray\&amp;#39;d Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles Of brazen Chariots rag\&amp;#39;d; dire was the noise Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew, And flying vaulted either Host with fire. So under fierie Cope together rush\&amp;#39;d Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault And inextinguishable rage; all Heav\&amp;#39;n Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought On either side, the least of whom could weild These Elements, and arm him with the force Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power Armie against Armie numberless to raise Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; Had not th\&amp;#39; Eternal King Omnipotent From his strong hold of Heav\&amp;#39;n high over-rul\&amp;#39;d And limited thir might; though numberd such As each divided Legion might have seemd A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway Of Battel, open when, and when to close The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight, None of retreat, no unbecoming deed That argu\&amp;#39;d fear; each on himself reli\&amp;#39;d, As onely in his arm the moment lay Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground A standing fight, then soaring on main wing Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes No equal, raunging through the dire attack Of fighting Seraphim confus\&amp;#39;d, at length Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell\&amp;#39;d Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand He hasted, and oppos\&amp;#39;d the rockie Orb Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield A vast circumference: At his approach The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile Surceas\&amp;#39;d, and glad as hoping here to end Intestine War in Heav\&amp;#39;n, the arch foe subdu\&amp;#39;d Or Captive drag\&amp;#39;d in Chains, with hostile frown And visage all enflam\&amp;#39;d first thus began. Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, Unnam\&amp;#39;d in Heav\&amp;#39;n, now plenteous, as thou seest These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, Though heaviest by just measure on thy self And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb d Heav\&amp;#39;ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought Miserie, uncreated till the crime Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill\&amp;#39;d Thy malice into thousands, once upright And faithful, now prov\&amp;#39;d false. But think not here To trouble Holy Rest; Heav\&amp;#39;n casts thee out From all her Confines. Heav\&amp;#39;n the seat of bliss Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. Hence then, and evil go with thee along Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell, Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, Or som more sudden vengeance wing\&amp;#39;d from God Precipitate thee with augmented paine. So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end The strife which thou call\&amp;#39;st evil, but wee style The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win, Or turn this Heav\&amp;#39;n it self into the Hell Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, And join him nam\&amp;#39;d Almighty to thy aid, I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. They ended parle, and both addrest for fight Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue Of Angels, can relate, or to what things Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, Stood they or mov\&amp;#39;d, in stature, motion, arms Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav\&amp;#39;n. Now wav\&amp;#39;d thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields Blaz\&amp;#39;d opposite, while expectation stood In horror; from each hand with speed retir\&amp;#39;d Where erst was thickest fight, th\&amp;#39; Angelic throng, And left large field, unsafe within the wind Of such commotion, such as to set forth Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, Among the Constellations warr were sprung, Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound. Together both with next to Almightie Arme, Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim\&amp;#39;d That might determine, and not need repeate, As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd In might or swift prevention; but the sword Of Michael from the Armorie of God Was giv\&amp;#39;n him temperd so, that neither keen Nor solid might resist that edge: it met The sword of Satan with steep force to smite Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar\&amp;#39;d All his right side; then Satan first knew pain, And writh\&amp;#39;d him to and fro convolv\&amp;#39;d; so sore The griding sword with discontinuous wound Pass\&amp;#39;d through him, but th\&amp;#39; Ethereal substance clos\&amp;#39;d Not long divisible, and from the gash A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow\&amp;#39;d Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, And all his Armour staind ere while so bright. Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run By Angels many and strong, who interpos\&amp;#39;d Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir\&amp;#39;d From off the files of warr; there they him laid Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame To find himself not matchless, and his pride Humbl\&amp;#39;d by such rebuke, so farr beneath His confidence to equal God in power. Yet soon he heal\&amp;#39;d; for Spirits that live throughout Vital in every part, not as frail man In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines; Cannot but by annihilating die; Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire: All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare, All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please, They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, And with fierce Ensignes pierc\&amp;#39;d the deep array Of Moloc furious King, who him defi\&amp;#39;d, And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound Threatn\&amp;#39;d, nor from the Holie One of Heav\&amp;#39;n Refrein\&amp;#39;d his tongue blasphemous; but anon Down clov\&amp;#39;n to the waste, with shatterd Armes And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, Vanquish\&amp;#39;d Adramelec, and Asmadai, Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods Disdain\&amp;#39;d, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, Mangl\&amp;#39;d with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile, Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy The Atheist crew, but with redoubl\&amp;#39;d blow Ariel and Arioc, and the violence Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. I might relate of thousands, and thir names Eternize here on Earth; but those elect Angels contented with thir fame in Heav\&amp;#39;n Seek not the praise of men: the other sort In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome Canceld from Heav\&amp;#39;n and sacred memorie, Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. For strength from Truth divided and from Just, Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. And now thir Mightiest quelld, the battel swerv\&amp;#39;d, With many an inrode gor\&amp;#39;d; deformed rout Enter\&amp;#39;d, and foul disorder; all the ground With shiverd armour strow\&amp;#39;n, and on a heap Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris\&amp;#39;d, Then first with fear surpris\&amp;#39;d and sense of paine Fled ignominious, to such evil brought By sin of disobedience, till that hour Not liable to fear or flight or paine. Far otherwise th\&amp;#39; inviolable Saints In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc\&amp;#39;t entire, Invulnerable, impenitrably arm\&amp;#39;d: Such high advantages thir innocence Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, Not to have disobei\&amp;#39;d; in fight they stood Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain\&amp;#39;d By wound, though from thir place by violence mov\&amp;#39;d. Now Night her course began, and over Heav\&amp;#39;n Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos\&amp;#39;d, And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: Under her Cloudie covert both retir\&amp;#39;d, Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field Michael and his Angels prevalent Encamping, plac\&amp;#39;d in Guard thir Watches round, Cherubic waving fires: on th\&amp;#39; other part Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, Far in the dark dislodg\&amp;#39;d, and void of rest, His Potentates to Councel call\&amp;#39;d by night; And in the midst thus undismai\&amp;#39;d began. O now in danger tri\&amp;#39;d, now known in Armes Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, Found worthy not of Libertie alone, Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send Against us from about his Throne, and judg\&amp;#39;d Sufficient to subdue us to his will, But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, Of future we may deem him, though till now Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm\&amp;#39;d, Some disadvantage we endur\&amp;#39;d and paine, Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, Since now we find this our Empyreal form Incapable of mortal injurie Imperishable, and though peirc\&amp;#39;d with wound, Soon closing, and by native vigour heal\&amp;#39;d. Of evil then so small as easie think The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, Weapons more violent, when next we meet, May serve to better us, and worse our foes, Or equal what between us made the odds, In Nature none: if other hidden cause Left them Superiour, while we can preserve Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, Due search and consultation will disclose. He sat; and in th\&amp;#39; assembly next upstood Nisroc of Principalities the prime; As one he stood escap\&amp;#39;t from cruel fight, Sore toild, his riv\&amp;#39;n Armes to havoc hewn, And cIoudie in aspect thus answering spake. Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard For Gods, and too unequal work we find Against unequal armes to fight in paine, Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, But live content, which is the calmest life: But pain is perfet miserie, the worst Of evils, and excessive, overturnes All patience. He who therefore can invent With what more forcible we may offend Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme Our selves with like defence, to me deserves No less then for deliverance what we owe. Whereto with look compos\&amp;#39;d Satan repli\&amp;#39;d. Not uninvented that, which thou aright Believst so main to our success, I bring; Which of us who beholds the bright surface Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, This continent of spacious Heav\&amp;#39;n, adornd With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms &amp;amp; Gold, Whose Eye so superficially surveyes These things, as not to mind from whence they grow Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht With Heav\&amp;#39;ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth So beauteous, op\&amp;#39;ning to the ambient light. These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame, Which into hallow Engins long and round Thick-rammd, at th\&amp;#39; other bore with touch of fire Dilated and infuriate shall send forth From far with thundring noise among our foes Such implements of mischief as shall dash To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive; Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. He ended, and his words thir drooping chere Enlightn\&amp;#39;d, and thir languisht hope reviv\&amp;#39;d. Th\&amp;#39; invention all admir\&amp;#39;d, and each, how hee To be th\&amp;#39; inventer miss\&amp;#39;d, so easie it seemd Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought Impossible: yet haply of thy Race In future dayes, if Malice should aboun, Some one intent on mischief, or inspir\&amp;#39;d With dev\&amp;#39;lish machination might devise Like instrument to plague the Sons of men For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, None arguing stood, innumerable hands Were ready, in a moment up they turnd Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath Th\&amp;#39; originals of Nature in thir crude Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame They found, they mingl\&amp;#39;d, and with suttle Art, Concocted and adusted they reduc\&amp;#39;d To blackest grain, and into store convey\&amp;#39;d: Part hidd\&amp;#39;n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls Of missive ruin; part incentive reed Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night Secret they finish\&amp;#39;d, and in order set, With silent circumspection unespi\&amp;#39;d. Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav\&amp;#39;n appeerd Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, Where lodg\&amp;#39;d, or whither fled, or if for fight, In motion or in alt: him soon they met Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri\&amp;#39;d. Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud He comes, and settl\&amp;#39;d in his face I see Sad resolution and secure: let each His Adamantine coat gird well, and each Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon In order, quit of all impediment; Instant without disturb they took Allarm, And onward move Embattelld; when behold Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube Training his devilish Enginrie, impal\&amp;#39;d On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, To hide the fraud. At interview both stood A while, but suddenly at head appeerd Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; That all may see who hate us, how we seek Peace and composure, and with open brest Stand readie to receive them, if they like Our overture, and turn not back perverse; But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, Heav\&amp;#39;n witness thou anon, while we discharge Freely our part; yee who appointed stand Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch What we propound, and loud that all may hear. So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front Divided, and to either Flank retir\&amp;#39;d. Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, A triple mounted row of Pillars laid On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem\&amp;#39;d Or hollow\&amp;#39;d bodies made of Oak or Firr With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell\&amp;#39;d) Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes With hideous orifice gap\&amp;#39;t on us wide, Portending hollow truce; at each behind A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, Collected stood within our thoughts amus\&amp;#39;d, Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli\&amp;#39;d With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, But soon obscur\&amp;#39;d with smoak, all Heav\&amp;#39;n appeerd, From those deep throated Engins belcht, whose roar Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule Thir devilish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host Level\&amp;#39;d, with such impetuous furie smote, That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl\&amp;#39;d; The sooner for thir Arms, unarm\&amp;#39;d they might Have easily as Spirits evaded swift By quick contraction or remove; but now Foule dissipation follow\&amp;#39;d and forc\&amp;#39;t rout; Nor serv\&amp;#39;d it to relax thir serried files. What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse Repeated, and indecent overthrow Doubl\&amp;#39;d, would render them yet more despis\&amp;#39;d, And to thir foes a laughter; for in view Stood rankt of Seraphim another row In posture to displode thir second tire Of Thunder: back defeated to return They worse abhorr\&amp;#39;d. Satan beheld thir plight, And to his Mates thus in derision call\&amp;#39;d. O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, To entertain them fair with open Front And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms Of composition, strait they chang\&amp;#39;d thir minds, Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose If our proposals once again were heard We should compel them to a quick result. To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood, Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, Of hard contents, and full of force urg\&amp;#39;d home, Such as we might perceive amus\&amp;#39;d them all, And stumbl\&amp;#39;d many, who receives them right, Had need from head to foot well understand; Not understood, this gift they have besides, They shew us when our foes walk not upright. So they among themselves in pleasant veine Stood scoffing, highthn\&amp;#39;d in thir thoughts beyond All doubt of Victorie, eternal might To match with thir inventions they presum\&amp;#39;d So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, And all his Host derided, while they stood A while in trouble; but they stood not long, Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac\&amp;#39;d) Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills (For Earth hath this variety from Heav\&amp;#39;n Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, From thir foundations loosning to and fro They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, Be sure, and terrour seis\&amp;#39;d the rebel Host, When coming towards them so dread they saw The bottom of the Mountains upward turn\&amp;#39;d, Till on those cursed Engins triple-row They saw them whelm\&amp;#39;d, and all thir confidence Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads Main Promontories flung, which in the Air Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm\&amp;#39;d, Thir armor help\&amp;#39;d thir harm, crush\&amp;#39;t in and bruis\&amp;#39;d Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. The rest in imitation to like Armes Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills Hurl\&amp;#39;d to and fro with jaculation dire That under ground, they fought in dismal shade; Infernal noise; Warr seem\&amp;#39;d a civil Game To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav\&amp;#39;n Had gon to wrack, with ruin overspred, Had not th\&amp;#39; Almightie Father where he sits Shrin\&amp;#39;d in his Sanctuarie of Heav\&amp;#39;n secure, Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen This tumult, and permitted all, advis\&amp;#39;d: That his great purpose he might so fulfill, To honour his Anointed Son aveng\&amp;#39;d Upon his enemies, and to declare All power on him transferr\&amp;#39;d: whence to his Son Th\&amp;#39; Assessor of his Throne he thus began. Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov\&amp;#39;d, Son in whose face invisible is beheld Visibly, what by Deitie I am, And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav\&amp;#39;n, Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm\&amp;#39;d; For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, Equal in their Creation they were form\&amp;#39;d, Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last Endless, and no solution will be found: Warr wearied hath perform\&amp;#39;d what Warr can do, And to disorder\&amp;#39;d rage let loose the reines, With Mountains as with Weapons arm\&amp;#39;d, which makes Wild work in Heav\&amp;#39;n, and dangerous to the maine. Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; For thee I have ordain\&amp;#39;d it, and thus farr Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace Immense I have transfus\&amp;#39;d, that all may know In Heav\&amp;#39;n and Hell thy Power above compare, And this perverse Commotion governd thus, To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things, to be Heir and to be King By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles That shake Heav\&amp;#39;ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out From all Heav\&amp;#39;ns bounds into the utter Deep: There let them learn, as likes them, to despise God and Messiah his anointed King. He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct Shon full, he all his Father full expresst Ineffably into his face receiv\&amp;#39;d, And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. O Father, O Supream of heav\&amp;#39;nly Thrones, First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, As is most just; this I my Glorie account, My exaltation, and my whole delight, That thou in me well pleas\&amp;#39;d, declarst thy will Fulfill\&amp;#39;d, which to fulfil is all my bliss. Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, And gladlier shall resign, when in the end Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov\&amp;#39;st: But whom thou hat\&amp;#39;st, I hate, and can put on Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, Armd with thy might, rid heav\&amp;#39;n of these rebell\&amp;#39;d, To thir prepar\&amp;#39;d ill Mansion driven down To chains of darkness, and th\&amp;#39; undying Worm, That from thy just obedience could revolt, Whom to obey is happiness entire. Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th\&amp;#39; impure Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. So said, he o\&amp;#39;re his Scepter bowing, rose From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, And the third sacred Morn began to shine Dawning through Heav\&amp;#39;n: forth rush\&amp;#39;d with whirlwind sound The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the wheels Of Beril, and careering Fires between; Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, Ascended, at his right hand Victorie Sate Eagle-wing\&amp;#39;d, beside him hung his Bow And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor\&amp;#39;d, And from about him fierce Effusion rowld Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, He onward came, farr off his coming shon, And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime On the Chrystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron\&amp;#39;d. Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz\&amp;#39;d, When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz\&amp;#39;d Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav\&amp;#39;n: Under whose conduct Michael soon reduc\&amp;#39;d His Armie, circumfus\&amp;#39;d on either Wing, Under thir Head imbodied all in one. Before him Power Divine his way prepar\&amp;#39;d; At his command the uprooted Hills retir\&amp;#39;d Each to his place, they heard his voice and went Obsequious, Heav\&amp;#39;n his wonted face renewd, And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil\&amp;#39;d. This saw his hapless Foes but stood obdur\&amp;#39;d, And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. In heav\&amp;#39;nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? But to convince the proud what Signs availe, Or Wonders move th\&amp;#39; obdurate to relent? They hard\&amp;#39;nd more by what might most reclame, Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, Stood reimbattell\&amp;#39;d fierce, by force or fraud Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile Against God and Messiah, or to fall In universal ruin last, and now To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God To all his Host on either hand thus spake. Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand Ye Angels arm\&amp;#39;d, this day from Battel rest; Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, And as ye have receivd, so have ye don Invincibly; but of this cursed crew The punishment to other hand belongs, Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; Number to this dayes work is not ordain\&amp;#39;d Nor multitude, stand onely and behold Gods indignation on these Godless pourd By mee, not you but mee they have despis\&amp;#39;d, Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, Because the Father, t\&amp;#39; whom in Heav\&amp;#39;n supream Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, Hath honourd me according to his will. Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig\&amp;#39;n\&amp;#39;d; That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, Or I alone against them, since by strength They measure all, of other excellence Not emulous, nor care who them excells; Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. So spake the Son, and into terrour chang\&amp;#39;d His count\&amp;#39;nance too severe to be beheld And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon Among them he arriv\&amp;#39;d; in his right hand Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent Before him, such as in thir Soules infix\&amp;#39;d Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, All courage; down thir idle weapons drop\&amp;#39;d; O\&amp;#39;re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, That wisht the Mountains now might be again Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. Nor less on either side tempestuous fell His arrows, from the fourfold-visag\&amp;#39;d Foure, Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, One Spirit in them rul\&amp;#39;d, and every eye Glar\&amp;#39;d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire Among th\&amp;#39; accurst, that witherd all thir strength, And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall\&amp;#39;n. Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check\&amp;#39;d His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav\&amp;#39;n: The overthrown he rais\&amp;#39;d, and as a Heard Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu\&amp;#39;d With terrors and with furies to the bounds And Chrystal wall of Heav\&amp;#39;n, which op\&amp;#39;ning wide, Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos\&amp;#39;d Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight Strook them with horror backward, but far worse Urg\&amp;#39;d them behind; headlong themselves they threw Down from the verge of Heav\&amp;#39;n, Eternal wrauth Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. Hell heard th\&amp;#39; unsufferable noise, Hell saw Heav\&amp;#39;n ruining from Heav\&amp;#39;n and would have fled Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos\&amp;#39;d, Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. Disburd\&amp;#39;nd Heav\&amp;#39;n rejoic\&amp;#39;d, and soon repaird Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. Sole Victor from th\&amp;#39; expulsion of his Foes Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, With Jubilie advanc\&amp;#39;d; and as they went, Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion giv\&amp;#39;n, Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode Triumphant through mid Heav\&amp;#39;n, into the Courts And Temple of his migihtie Father Thron\&amp;#39;d On high: who into Glorie him receav\&amp;#39;d, Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. Thus measuring things in Heav\&amp;#39;n by things on Earth At thy request, and that thou maist beware By what is past, to thee I have reveal\&amp;#39;d What might have else to human Race bin hid; The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav\&amp;#39;n Among th\&amp;#39; Angelic Powers, and the deep fall Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, Who now is plotting how he may seduce Thee also from obedience, that with him Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake His punishment, Eternal miserie; Which would be all his solace and revenge, As a despite don against the most High, Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. But list\&amp;#39;n not to his Temptations, warne Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard By terrible Example the reward Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;DEscend from Heav&amp;#39;n Urania, by that name If rightly thou art call&amp;#39;d, whose Voice divine Following, above th&amp;#39; Olympian Hill I soare, Above the flight of Pegasean wing. The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top Of old Olympus dwell&amp;#39;st, but Heav&amp;#39;nlie borne, Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow&amp;#39;d, Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse, Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play In presence of th&amp;#39; Almightie Father, pleas&amp;#39;d With thy Celestial Song. Up led by thee Into the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heav&amp;#39;ns I have presum&amp;#39;d, An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down Return me to my Native Element: Least from this flying Steed unrein&amp;#39;d, (as once Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime) Dismounted, on th&amp;#39; Aleian Field I fall Erroneous there to wander and forlorne. Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang&amp;#39;d To hoarce or mute, though fall&amp;#39;n on evil dayes, On evil dayes though fall&amp;#39;n, and evil tongues; In darkness, and with dangers compast round, And solitude; yet not alone, while thou Visit&amp;#39;st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, Urania, and fit audience find, though few. But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his revellers, the Race Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares To rapture, till the savage clamor dround Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores: For thou are Heav&amp;#39;nlie, shee an emptie dreame. Say Goddess, what ensu&amp;#39;d when Raphael, The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarn&amp;#39;d Adam by dire example to beware Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven To those Apostates, least the like befall In Paradise to Adam or his Race, Charg&amp;#39;d not to touch the interdicted Tree, If they transgress, and slight that sole command, So easily obeyd amid the choice Of all tastes else to please thir appetite, Though wandring. He with his consorted Eve The storie heard attentive, and was fill&amp;#39;d With admiration, and deep Muse to hear Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought So unimaginable as hate in Heav&amp;#39;n, And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss With such confusion: but the evil soon Driv&amp;#39;n back redounded as a flood on those From whom it sprung, impossible to mix With Blessedness. Whence Adam soon repeal&amp;#39;d The doubts that in his heart arose: and now Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know What neerer might concern him, how this World Of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth conspicious first began, When, and whereof created, for what cause, What within Eden or without was done Before his memorie, as one whose drouth Yet scarce allay&amp;#39;d still eyes the current streame, Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, Proceeded thus to ask his Heav&amp;#39;nly Guest. Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal&amp;#39;d Divine interpreter, by favour sent Down from the Empyrean to forewarne Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: For which to the infinitly Good we owe Immortal thanks, and his admonishment Receave with solemne purpose to observe Immutably his sovran will, the end Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf&amp;#39;t Gently for our instruction to impart Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, Deign to descend now lower, and relate What may no less perhaps availe us known, How first began this Heav&amp;#39;n which we behold Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus&amp;#39;d Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause Mov&amp;#39;d the Creator in his holy Rest Through all Eternitie so late to build In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon Absolv&amp;#39;d, if unforbid thou maist unfould What wee, not to explore the secrets aske Of his Eternal Empire, but the more To magnifie his works, the more we know. And the great Light of Day yet wants to run Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav&amp;#39;n Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, And longer will delay to heare thee tell His Generation, and the rising Birth Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought: And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. This also thy request with caution askt Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve To glorifie the Maker, and inferr Thee also happier, shall not be withheld Thy hearing, such Commission from above I have receav&amp;#39;d, to answer thy desire Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope Things not reveal&amp;#39;d, which th&amp;#39; invisible King, Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: Anough is left besides to search and know. But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less Her Temperance over Appetite, to know In measure what the mind may well contain, Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav&amp;#39;n (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep Into his place, and the great Son returnd Victorious with his Saints, th&amp;#39; Omnipotent Eternal Father from his Throne beheld Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. At least our envious Foe hath fail&amp;#39;d, who thought All like himself rebellious, by whose aid This inaccessible high strength, the seat Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, He trusted to have seis&amp;#39;d, and into fraud Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, Thir station, Heav&amp;#39;n yet populous retaines Number sufficient to possess her Realmes Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: But least his heart exalt him in the harme Already done, to have dispeopl&amp;#39;d Heav&amp;#39;n My damage fondly deem&amp;#39;d, I can repaire That detriment, if such it be to lose Self-lost, and in a moment will create Another World, out of one man a Race Of men innumerable, there to dwell, Not here, till by degrees of merit rais&amp;#39;d They open to themselves at length the way Up hither, under long obedience tri&amp;#39;d, And Earth be chang&amp;#39;d to Heav&amp;#39;n, &amp;amp; Heav&amp;#39;n to Earth, One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav&amp;#39;n, And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep Within appointed bounds be Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. Though I uncircumscrib&amp;#39;d my self retire, And put not forth my goodness, which is free To act or not, Necessitie and Chance Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. So spake th&amp;#39; Almightie, and to what he spake His Word, the filial Godhead, gave effect. Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift Then time or motion, but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told, So told as earthly notion can receave. Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav&amp;#39;n When such was heard declar&amp;#39;d the Almightie&amp;#39;s will; Glorie they sung to the most High, good will To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: Glorie to him whose just avenging ire Had driven out th&amp;#39; ungodly from his sight And th&amp;#39; habitations of the just; to him Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain&amp;#39;d Good out of evil to create, in stead Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son On his great Expedition now appeer&amp;#39;d, Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown&amp;#39;d Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love Immense, and all his Father in him shon. About his Chariot numberless were pour&amp;#39;d Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing&amp;#39;d, From the Armoury of God, where stand of old Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg&amp;#39;d Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, Celestial Equipage; and now came forth Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, Attendant on thir Lord: Heav&amp;#39;n op&amp;#39;nd wide Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound On golden Hinges moving, to let forth The King of Glorie in his powerful Word And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. On heav&amp;#39;nly ground they stood, and from the shore They view&amp;#39;d the vast immeasurable Abyss Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, Up from the bottom turn&amp;#39;d by furious windes And surging waves, as Mountains to assault Heav&amp;#39;ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. Silence, ye troubl&amp;#39;d waves, and thou Deep, peace, Said then th&amp;#39; Omnific Word, your discord end: Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine Follow&amp;#39;d in bright procession to behold Creation, and the wonders of his might. Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand He took the golden Compasses, prepar&amp;#39;d In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe This Universe, and all created things: One foot he center&amp;#39;d, and the other turn&amp;#39;d Round through the vast profunditie obscure, And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, This be thy just Circumference, O World. Thus God the Heav&amp;#39;n created, thus the Earth, Matter unform&amp;#39;d and void: Darkness profound Cover&amp;#39;d th&amp;#39; Abyss: but on the watrie calme His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, And vital vertue infus&amp;#39;d, and vital warmth Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg&amp;#39;d The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob&amp;#39;d Like things to like, the rest to several place Disparted, and between spun out the Air, And Earth self ballanc&amp;#39;t on her Center hung. Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East To journie through the airie gloom began, Sphear&amp;#39;d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle Sojourn&amp;#39;d the while. God saw the Light was good; And light from darkness by the Hemisphere Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night He nam&amp;#39;d. Thus was the first Day Eev&amp;#39;n and Morn: Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; Birth-day of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth; with joy and shout The hollow Universal Orb they fill&amp;#39;d, And touch&amp;#39;t thir Golden Harps, and hymning prais&amp;#39;d God and his works, Creatour him they sung, Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. Again, God said, let ther be Firmament Amid the Waters, and let it divide The Waters from the Waters: and God made The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus&amp;#39;d In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, The Waters underneath from those above Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule Of Chaos farr remov&amp;#39;d, least fierce extreames Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: And Heav&amp;#39;n he nam&amp;#39;d the Firmament: So Eev&amp;#39;n And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. The Earth was form&amp;#39;d, but in the Womb as yet Of Waters, Embryon immature involv&amp;#39;d, Appeer&amp;#39;d not: over all the face of Earth Main Ocean flow&amp;#39;d, not idle, but with warme Prolific humour soft&amp;#39;ning all her Globe, Fermented the great Mother to conceave, Satiate with genial moisture, when God said Be gather&amp;#39;d now ye Waters under Heav&amp;#39;n Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. Immediately the Mountains huge appeer Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: So high as heav&amp;#39;d the tumid Hills, so low Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, Capacious bed of Waters: thither they Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, For haste; such flight the great command impress&amp;#39;d On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, But they, or under ground, or circuit wide With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; Easie, e&amp;#39;re God had bid the ground be drie, All but within those banks, where Rivers now Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle Of congregated Waters he call&amp;#39;d Seas: And saw that it was good, and said, Let th&amp;#39; Earth Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed, And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind; Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn&amp;#39;d, Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad Her Universal Face with pleasant green, Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour&amp;#39;d Op&amp;#39;ning thir various colours, and made gay Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, Forth flourish&amp;#39;t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed Embattell&amp;#39;d in her field: and the humble Shrub, And Bush with frizl&amp;#39;d hair implicit: last Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm&amp;#39;d Thir blossoms: with high woods the hills were crownd, With tufts the vallies and each fountain side, With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now Seemd like to Heav&amp;#39;n, a seat where Gods might dwell, Or wander with delight, and love to haunt Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain&amp;#39;d Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist Went up and waterd all the ground, and each Plant of the field, which e&amp;#39;re it was in the Earth God made, and every Herb, before it grew On the green stemm; God saw that it was good. So Eev&amp;#39;n and Morn recorded the Third Day. Again th&amp;#39; Almightie spake: Let there be Lights High in th&amp;#39; expanse of Heaven to divide The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, And let them be for Lights as I ordaine Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav&amp;#39;n To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. And God made two great Lights, great for thir use To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, And set them in the Firmament of Heav&amp;#39;n To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, Surveying his great Work, that it was good: For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun A mightie Spheare he fram&amp;#39;d, unlightsom first, Though of Ethereal Mould: then form&amp;#39;d the Moon Globose, and every magnitude of Starrs, And sowd with Starrs the Heav&amp;#39;n thick as a field: Of Light by farr the greater part he took, Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac&amp;#39;d In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine Her gather&amp;#39;d beams, great Palace now of Light. Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs Repairing, in thir gold&amp;#39;n Urns draw Light, And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns; By tincture or reflection they augment Thir small peculiar, though from human sight So farr remote, with diminution seen. First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, Regent of Day, and all th&amp;#39; Horizon round Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run His Longitude through Heav&amp;#39;ns high rode: the gray Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc&amp;#39;d Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, But opposite in leveld West was set His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light From him, for other light she needed none In that aspect, and still that distance keepes Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, Revolvd on Heav&amp;#39;ns great Axle, and her Reign With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer&amp;#39;d Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, Glad Eevning and glad Morn crownd the fourth day. And God said, let the Waters generate Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings Displayd on the op&amp;#39;n Firmament of Heav&amp;#39;n. And God created the great Whales, and each Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously The waters generated by thir kindes, And every Bird of wing after his kinde; And saw that it was good, and bless&amp;#39;d them, saying, Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; And let the Fowle be multiply&amp;#39;d on the Earth. Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek and Bay With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, and through Groves Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance Show to the Sun thir wav&amp;#39;d coats dropt with Gold, Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos&amp;#39;d Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge They summ&amp;#39;d thir Penns, and soaring th&amp;#39; air sublime With clang despis&amp;#39;d the ground, under a cloud In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise In common, rang&amp;#39;d in figure wedge thir way, Intelligent of seasons, and set forth Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea&amp;#39;s Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire Floats, as they pass, fann&amp;#39;d with unnumber&amp;#39;d plumes: From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song So1ac&amp;#39;d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings Till Ev&amp;#39;n, nor then the solemn Nightingal Ceas&amp;#39;d warbling, but all night tun&amp;#39;d her soft layes: Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath&amp;#39;d Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground Walk&amp;#39;d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds The silent hours, and th&amp;#39; other whose gay Traine Adorns him, colour&amp;#39;d with the Florid hue Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, Ev&amp;#39;ning and Morn solemniz&amp;#39;d the Fift day. The Sixt, and of Creation last arose With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, Let th&amp;#39; Earth bring forth Foul living in her kinde, Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, Each in their kinde. The Earth obey&amp;#39;d, and strait Op&amp;#39;ning her fertil Woomb teem&amp;#39;d at a Birth Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, Limb&amp;#39;d and full grown: out of the ground up rose As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk&amp;#39;d: The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung. The grassie Clods now Calv&amp;#39;d, now half appeer&amp;#39;d The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale Rising, the crumbl&amp;#39;d Earth above them threw In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav&amp;#39;d His vastness: Fleec&amp;#39;t the Flocks and bleating rose, As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, Insect or Worme; those wav&amp;#39;d thir limber fans For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: These as a line thir long dimension drew, Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde Wondrous in length and corpulence involv&amp;#39;d Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept The Parsimonious Emmet, provident Of future, in small room large heart enclos&amp;#39;d, Pattern of just equalitie perhaps Hereafter, join&amp;#39;d in her popular Tribes Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer&amp;#39;d The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells With Honey stor&amp;#39;d: the rest are numberless, And thou thir Natures know&amp;#39;st, &amp;amp; gav&amp;#39;st them Names, Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown The Serpent suttl&amp;#39;st Beast of all the field, Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes And hairie Main terrific, though to thee Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. Now Heav&amp;#39;n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld Her motions, as the great first Movers hand First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire Consummate lovly smil&amp;#39;d; Aire, Water, Earth, By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain&amp;#39;d; There wanted yet the Master work, the end Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone And Brute as other Creatures, but endu&amp;#39;d With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect His Stature, and upright with Front serene Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence Magnanimous to correspond with Heav&amp;#39;n, But grateful to acknowledge whence his good Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes Directed in Devotion, to adore And worship God Supream, who made him chief Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent Eternal Father (For where is not hee Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. Let us make now Man in our image, Man In our similitude, and let them rule Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath&amp;#39;d The breath of Life; in his own Image hee Created thee, in the Image of God Express, and thou becam&amp;#39;st a living Soul. Male he created thee, but thy consort Female for Race; then bless&amp;#39;d Mankinde, and said, Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, And every living thing that moves on the Earth. Wherever thus created, for no place Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knows&amp;#39;t He brought thee into this delicious Grove, This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, Delectable both to behold and taste; And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th&amp;#39; Earth yields, Varietie without end; but of the Tree Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, Thou mai&amp;#39;st not; in the day thou eat&amp;#39;st, thou di&amp;#39;st; Death is the penaltie impos&amp;#39;d, beware, And govern well thy appetite, least sin Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. Here finish&amp;#39;d hee, and all that he had made View&amp;#39;d, and behold all was entirely good; So Ev&amp;#39;n and Morn accomplish&amp;#39;d the Sixt day: Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd Up to the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heav&amp;#39;ns his high abode, Thence to behold this new created World Th&amp;#39; addition of his Empire, how it shew&amp;#39;d In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, Answering his great Idea. Up he rode Followd with acclamation and the sound Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun&amp;#39;d Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire Resounded, (thou remember&amp;#39;st, for thou heardst) The Heav&amp;#39;ns and all the Constellations rung, The Planets in thir station list&amp;#39;ning stood, While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, Open, ye Heav&amp;#39;ns, your living dores; let in The great Creator from his work returnd Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne To visit oft the dwellings of just Men Delighted, and with frequent intercourse Thither will send his winged Messengers On errands of supernal Grace. So sung The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav&amp;#39;n, That open&amp;#39;d wide her blazing Portals, led To Gods Eternal house direct the way, A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seventh Eev&amp;#39;ning arose in Eden, for the Sun Was set, and twilight from the East came on, Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount Of Heav&amp;#39;ns high-seated top, th&amp;#39; Impereal Throne Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, The Filial Power arriv&amp;#39;d, and sate him down With his great Father (for he also went Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain&amp;#39;d, Author and end of all things, and from work Now resting, bless&amp;#39;d and hallowd the Seav&amp;#39;nth day, As resting on that day from all his work, But not in silence holy kept; the Harp Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire Temper&amp;#39;d sort Tunings, intermixt with Voice Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue Relate thee; greater now in thy return Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day Thy Thunders magnifi&amp;#39;d; but to create Is greater then created to destroy. Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes To lessen thee, against his purpose serves To manifest the more thy might: his evil Thou usest, and from thence creat&amp;#39;st more good. Witness this new-made World, another Heav&amp;#39;n From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr&amp;#39;s Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World Of destind habitation; but thou know&amp;#39;st Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus&amp;#39;d, Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men, And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc&amp;#39;t, Created in his Image, there to dwell And worship him, and in reward to rule Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, And multiply a Race of Worshippers Holy and just: thrice happie if they know Thir happiness, and persevere upright. So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept. And thy request think now fulfill&amp;#39;d, that ask&amp;#39;d How first this World and face of things began, And what before thy memorie was don From the beginning, that posteritie Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;THE Angel ended, and in Adams Eare So Charming left his voice, that he a while Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to hear; Then as new wak&amp;#39;t thus gratefully repli&amp;#39;d. What thanks sufficient, or what recompence Equal have I to render thee, Divine Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf&amp;#39;t This friendly condescention to relate Things else by me unsearchable, now heard With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, With glorie attributed to the high Creator; something yet of doubt remaines, Which onely thy solution can resolve. When I behold this goodly Frame, this World Of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth consisting, and compute, Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine, An Atom, with the Firmament compar&amp;#39;d And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle Spaces incomprehensible (for such Thir distance argues and thir swift return Diurnal) meerly to officiate light Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, One day and night; in all thir vast survey Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire, How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions, with superfluous hand So many nobler Bodies to create, Greater so manifold to this one use, For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth, That better might with farr less compass move, Serv&amp;#39;d by more noble then her self, attaines Her end without least motion, and receaves, As Tribute such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. So spake our Sire, and by his count&amp;#39;nance seemd Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve Perceaving where she sat retir&amp;#39;d in sight, With lowliness Majestic from her seat, And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay, Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours, To visit how they prosper&amp;#39;d, bud and bloom, Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew. Yet went she not, as not with such discourse Delighted, or not capable her eare Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv&amp;#39;d, Adam relating, she sole Auditress; Her Husband the Relater she preferr&amp;#39;d Before the Angel, and of him to ask Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip Not Words alone pleas&amp;#39;d her. O when meet now Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn&amp;#39;d? With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went; Not unattended, for on her as Queen A pomp of winning Graces waited still, And from about her shot Darts of desire Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight. And Raphael now to Adam&amp;#39;s doubt propos&amp;#39;d Benevolent and facil thus repli&amp;#39;d. To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav&amp;#39;n Is as the Book of God before thee set, Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne His Seasons, Hours, or Dayes, or Months, or Yeares: This to attain, whether Heav&amp;#39;n move or Earth, Imports not, if thou reck&amp;#39;n right, the rest From Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge His secrets to be scann&amp;#39;d by them who ought Rather admire; or if they list to try Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav&amp;#39;ns Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide Hereafter, when they come to model Heav&amp;#39;n And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear With Centric and Eccentric scribl&amp;#39;d o&amp;#39;re, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb: Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest That bodies bright and greater should not serve The less not bright, nor Heav&amp;#39;n such journies run, Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves The benefit: consider first, that Great Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth Though, in comparison of Heav&amp;#39;n, so small, Nor glistering, may of solid good containe More plenty then the Sun that barren shines Whose vertue on it self workes no effect, But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd His beams, unactive else, thir vigour find. Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. And for the Heav&amp;#39;ns wide Circuit, let it speak The Makers high magnificence, who built So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; That Man may know he dwells not in his own; An Edifice too large for him to fill, Lodg&amp;#39;d in a small partition, and the rest Ordain&amp;#39;d for uses to his Lord best known. The swiftness of those Circles attribute Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, That to corporeal substances could adde Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav&amp;#39;n Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv&amp;#39;d In Eden, distance inexpressible By Numbers that have name. But this I urge, Admitting Motion in the Heav&amp;#39;ns, to shew Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov&amp;#39;d; Not that I so affirm, though so it seem To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. God to remove his wayes from human sense, Plac&amp;#39;d Heav&amp;#39;n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, If it presume, might erre in things too high, And no advantage gaine. What if the Sun Be Center to the World, and other Starrs By his attractive vertue and thir own Incited, dance about him various rounds? Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, In six thou seest, and what if sev&amp;#39;nth to these The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, Insensibly three different Motions move? Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, Mov&amp;#39;d contrarie with thwart obliquities, Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos&amp;#39;d, Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day Travelling East, and with her part averse From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part Still luminous by his ray. What if that light Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce Fruits in her soft&amp;#39;nd Soile, for some to eate Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie Communicating Male and Femal Light, Which two great Sexes animate the World, Stor&amp;#39;d in each Orb perhaps with some that live. For such vast room in Nature unpossest By living Soule, desert and desolate, Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr Down to this habitable, which returnes Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. But whether thus these things, or whether not, Whether the Sun predominant in Heav&amp;#39;n Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, Or Shee from West her silent course advance With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev&amp;#39;n, And beares thee soft with the smooth Air along, Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, Wherever plac&amp;#39;t, let him dispose: joy thou In what he gives to thee, this Paradise And thy faire Eve; Heav&amp;#39;n is for thee too high To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:. Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there Live, in what state, condition or degree, Contented that thus farr hath been reveal&amp;#39;d Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav&amp;#39;n. To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli&amp;#39;d. How fully hast thou satisfi&amp;#39;d mee, pure Intelligence of Heav&amp;#39;n, Angel serene, And freed from intricacies, taught to live, The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, And not molest us, unless we our selves Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vain. But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; Till warn&amp;#39;d, or by experience taught, she learne, That not to know at large of things remote From use, obscure and suttle, but to know That which before us lies in daily life, Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, And renders us in things that most concerne Unpractis&amp;#39;d, unprepar&amp;#39;d, and still to seek. Therefore from this high pitch let us descend A lower flight, and speak of things at hand Useful, whence haply mention may arise Of somthing not unseasonable to ask By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign&amp;#39;d. Thee I have heard relating what was don Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest How suttly to detaine thee I devise, Inviting thee to hear while I relate, Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav&amp;#39;n, And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst And hunger both, from labour, at the houre Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine Imbu&amp;#39;d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. To whom thus Raphael answer&amp;#39;d heav&amp;#39;nly meek. Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee Abundantly his gifts hath also pour&amp;#39;d Inward and outward both, his image faire: Speaking or mute all comliness and grace Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes, Nor less think wee in Heav&amp;#39;n of thee on Earth Then of our fellow servant, and inquire Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: For God we see hath honour&amp;#39;d thee, and set On Man his Equal Love: say therefore on; For I that Day was absent, as befell, Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; Squar&amp;#39;d in full Legion (such command we had) To see that none thence issu&amp;#39;d forth a spie, Or enemie, while God was in his work, Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, Destruction with Creation might have mixt. Not that they durst without his leave attempt, But us he sends upon his high behests For state, as Sovran King, and to enure Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut The dismal Gates, and barricado&amp;#39;d strong; But long ere our approaching heard within Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage. Glad we return&amp;#39;d up to the coasts of Light Ere Sabbath Eev&amp;#39;ning: so we had in charge. But thy relation now; for I attend, Pleas&amp;#39;d with thy words no less then thou with mine. So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. For Man to tell how human Life began Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? Desire with thee still longer to converse Induc&amp;#39;d me. As new wak&amp;#39;t from soundest sleep Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun Soon dri&amp;#39;d, and on the reaking moisture fed. Strait toward Heav&amp;#39;n my wondring Eyes I turnd, And gaz&amp;#39;d a while the ample Skie, till rais&amp;#39;d By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, As thitherward endevoring, and upright Stood on my feet; about me round I saw Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk&amp;#39;d, or flew, Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil&amp;#39;d, With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow&amp;#39;d. My self I then perus&amp;#39;d, and Limb by Limb Survey&amp;#39;d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran With supple joints, and lively vigour led: But who I was, or where, or from what cause, Knew not; to speak I tri&amp;#39;d, and forthwith spake My Tongue obey&amp;#39;d and readily could name What e&amp;#39;re I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, And thou enlight&amp;#39;nd Earth, so fresh and gay, Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? Not of my self; by some great Maker then, In goodness and in power praeeminent; Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, From whom I have that thus I move and live, And feel that I am happier then I know. While thus I call&amp;#39;d, and stray&amp;#39;d I knew not whither, From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld This happie Light, when answer none return&amp;#39;d, On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep First found me, and with soft oppression seis&amp;#39;d My droused sense, untroubl&amp;#39;d, though I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, Whose inward apparition gently mov&amp;#39;d My fancy to believe I yet had being, And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, First Man, of Men innumerable ordain&amp;#39;d First Father, call&amp;#39;d by thee I come thy Guide To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar&amp;#39;d. So saying, by the hand he took me rais&amp;#39;d, And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire Smooth sliding without step, last led me up A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, A Circuit wide, enclos&amp;#39;d, with goodliest Trees Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd. Each Tree Load&amp;#39;n with fairest Fruit that hung to the Eye Tempting, stirr&amp;#39;d in me sudden appetite To pluck and eate; whereat I wak&amp;#39;d, and found Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide Up hither, from among the Trees appeer&amp;#39;d Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss: he rear&amp;#39;d me, and Whom thou soughtst I am, Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest Above, or round about thee or beneath. This Paradise I give thee, count it thine To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: Of every Tree that in the Garden growes Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: But of the Tree whose operation brings Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, And shun the bitter consequence: for know, The day thou eat&amp;#39;st thereof, my sole command Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; From that day mortal, and this happie State Shalt loose, expell&amp;#39;d from hence into a World Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc&amp;#39;d The rigid interdiction, which resounds Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect Return&amp;#39;d and gracious purpose thus renew&amp;#39;d. Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords Possess it, and all things that therein live, Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold After thir kindes; I bring them to receave From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie With low subjection; understand the same Of Fish within thir watry residence, Not hither summond, since they cannot change Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold Approaching two and two, These cowring low With blandishment, each Bird stoop&amp;#39;d on his wing. I nam&amp;#39;d them, as they pass&amp;#39;d, and understood Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu&amp;#39;d My sudden apprehension: but in these I found not what me thought I wanted still; And to the Heav&amp;#39;nly vision thus presum&amp;#39;d. O by what Name, for thou above all these, Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, Surpassest farr my naming, how may I Adore thee, Author of this Universe, And all this good to man, for whose well being So amply, and with hands so liberal Thou hast provided all things: but with mee I see not who partakes. In solitude What happiness, who can enjoy alone, Or all enjoying, what contentment find? Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, As with a smile more bright&amp;#39;nd, thus repli&amp;#39;d. What call&amp;#39;st thou solitude, is not the Earth With various living creatures, and the Aire Replenisht, and all these at thy command To come and play before thee, know&amp;#39;st thou not Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, And reason not contemptibly; with these Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. So spake the Universal Lord, and seem&amp;#39;d So ordering. I with leave of speech implor&amp;#39;d, And humble deprecation thus repli&amp;#39;d. Let not my words offend thee, Heav&amp;#39;nly Power, My Maker, be propitious while I speak. Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, And these inferiour farr beneath me set? Among unequals what societie Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? Which must be mutual, in proportion due Giv&amp;#39;n and receiv&amp;#39;d; but in disparitie The one intense, the other still remiss Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek, fit to participate All rational delight, wherein the brute Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin&amp;#39;d; Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. Whereto th&amp;#39; Almighty answer&amp;#39;d, not displeas&amp;#39;d. A nice and suttle happiness I see Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, Seem I to thee sufficiently possest Of happiness, or not? who am alone From all Eternitie, for none I know Second to me or like, equal much less. How have I then with whom to hold converse Save with the Creatures which I made, and those To me inferiour, infinite descents Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? He ceas&amp;#39;d, I lowly answer&amp;#39;d. To attaine The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee Is no deficience found; not so is Man, But in degree, the cause of his desire By conversation with his like to help, Or solace his defects. No need that thou Shouldst propagat, already infinite; And through all numbers absolute, though One; But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection, and beget Like of his like, his Image multipli&amp;#39;d, In unitie defective, which requires Collateral love, and deerest amitie. Thou in thy secresie although alone, Best with thy self accompanied, seek&amp;#39;st not Social communication, yet so pleas&amp;#39;d, Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt Of Union or Communion, deifi&amp;#39;d; I by conversing cannot these erect From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. Thus I embold&amp;#39;nd spake, and freedom us&amp;#39;d Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain&amp;#39;d This answer from the gratious voice Divine. Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas&amp;#39;d, And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, Which thou hast rightly nam&amp;#39;d, but of thy self, Expressing well the spirit within thee free, My Image, not imparted to the Brute, Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak&amp;#39;st, Knew it not good for Man to be alone, And no such companie as then thou saw&amp;#39;st Intended thee, for trial onely brought, To see how thou could&amp;#39;st judge of fit and meet: What next I bring shall please thee, be assur&amp;#39;d, Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire. Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now My earthly by his Heav&amp;#39;nly overpowerd, Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth In that celestial Colloquie sublime, As with an object that excels the sense, Dazl d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call&amp;#39;d By Nature as in aide, and clos&amp;#39;d mine eyes. Mine eyes he clos&amp;#39;d, but op&amp;#39;n left the Cell Of Fancie my internal sight, by which Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood; Who stooping op&amp;#39;nd my left side, and took From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, But suddenly with flesh fill&amp;#39;d up and heal&amp;#39;d: The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; Under his forming hands a Creature grew, Manlike, but different Sex, so lovly faire, That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd And in her looks, which from that time infus&amp;#39;d Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, And into all things from her Aire inspir&amp;#39;d The spirit of love and amorous delight. Shee disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak&amp;#39;d To find her, or for ever to deplore Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable: On she came, Led by her Heav&amp;#39;nly Maker, though unseen, And guided by his voice, nor uninformd Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: Grace was in all her steps, Heav&amp;#39;n in her Eye, In every gesture dignitie and love. I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill&amp;#39;d Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, Giver of all things faire, but fairest this Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, That would be woo&amp;#39;d, and not unsought be won, Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir&amp;#39;d, The more desirable, or to say all, Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn&amp;#39;d; I follow&amp;#39;d her, she what was Honour knew, And with obsequious Majestie approv&amp;#39;d My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav&amp;#39;n, And happie Constellations on that houre Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires Whisper&amp;#39;d it to the Woods, and from thir wings Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss Which I enjoy, and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed, but such As us&amp;#39;d or not, works in the mind no change, Nor vehement desire, these delicacies I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, and Flours, Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here Farr otherwise, transported I behold, Transported touch; here passion first I felt, Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else Superiour and unmov&amp;#39;d, here onely weake Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part Not proof enough such Object to sustain, Or from my side subducting, took perhaps More then enough; at least on her bestow&amp;#39;d Too much of Ornament, in outward shew Elaborate, of inward less exact. For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her th&amp;#39; inferiour, in the mind And inward Faculties, which most excell, In outward also her resembling less His Image who made both, and less expressing The character of that Dominion giv&amp;#39;n O&amp;#39;re other Creatures; yet when I approach Her loveliness, so absolute she seems And in her self compleat, so well to know Her own, that what she wills to do or say, Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her Looses discount&amp;#39;nanc&amp;#39;t, and like folly shewes; Authority and Reason on her waite, As one intended first, not after made Occasionally; and to consummate all, Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat Build in her loveliest, and create an awe About her, as a guard Angelic plac&amp;#39;t. To whom the Angel with contracted brow. Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; Do thou but thine, and be not diffident Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, By attributing overmuch to things Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav&amp;#39;st. For what admir&amp;#39;st thou, what transports thee so, An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; Then value: Oft times nothing profits more Then self esteem, grounded on just and right Well manag&amp;#39;d; of that skill the more thou know&amp;#39;st, The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, And to realities yield all her shows: Made so adorn for thy delight the more, So awful, that with honour thou maist love Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. But if the sense of touch whereby mankind Is propagated seem such dear delight Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf&amp;#39;t To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be To them made common and divulg&amp;#39;d, if aught Therein enjoy&amp;#39;d were worthy to subdue The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. What higher in her societie thou findst Attractive, human, rational, love still; In loving thou dost well, in passion not, Wherein true Love consists not; love refines The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale By which to heav&amp;#39;nly Love thou maist ascend, Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. To whom thus half abash&amp;#39;t Adam repli&amp;#39;d. Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught In procreation common to all kindes (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, And with mysterious reverence I deem) So much delights me as those graceful acts, Those thousand decencies that daily flow From all her words and actions mixt with Love And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign&amp;#39;d Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; Harmonie to behold in wedded pair More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, Who meet with various objects, from the sense Variously representing; yet still free Approve the best, and follow what I approve. To love thou blam&amp;#39;st me not, for love thou saist Leads up to Heav&amp;#39;n, is both the way and guide; Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; Love not the heav&amp;#39;nly Spirits, and how thir Love Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? To whom the Angel with a smile that glow&amp;#39;d Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, Answer&amp;#39;d. Let it suffice thee that thou know&amp;#39;st Us happie, and without Love no happiness. Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy&amp;#39;st (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy In eminence, and obstacle find none Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: Easier then Air with Air; if Spirits embrace, Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure Desiring; nor restrain&amp;#39;d conveyance need As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. But I can now no more; the parting Sun Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all Him whom to love is to obey, and keep His great command; take heed least Passion sway Thy judgement to do aught, which else free Will Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons The weal or woe in thee is plac&amp;#39;t; beware. I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. Perfet within, no outward aid require; And all temptation to transgress repel. So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus Follow&amp;#39;d with benediction. Since to part, Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. Gentle to me and affable hath been Thy condescension, and shall be honour&amp;#39;d ever With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind Be good and friendly still, and oft return. So parted they, the Angel up to Heav&amp;#39;n From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;NO more of talk where God or Angel Guest With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us&amp;#39;d To sit indulgent, and with him partake Rural repast, permitting him the while Venial discourse unblam&amp;#39;d: I now must change Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt, And disobedience: On the part of Heav&amp;#39;n Now alienated, distance and distaste, Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv&amp;#39;n, That brought into this World a world of woe, Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursu&amp;#39;d Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous&amp;#39;d, Or Neptun&amp;#39;s ire or Juno&amp;#39;s, that so long Perplex&amp;#39;d the Greek and Cytherea&amp;#39;s Son; If answerable style I can obtaine Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes Her nightly visitation unimplor&amp;#39;d, And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires Easie my unpremeditated Verse: Since first this Subject for Heroic Song Pleas&amp;#39;d me long choosing, and beginning late; Not sedulous by Nature to indite Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument Heroic deem&amp;#39;d, chief maistrie to dissect With long and tedious havoc fabl&amp;#39;d Knights In Battels feign&amp;#39;d; the better fortitude Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom Unsung; or to describe Races and Games, Or tilting Furniture, emblazon&amp;#39;d Shields, Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds; Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights At Joust and Torneament; then marshal&amp;#39;d Feast Serv&amp;#39;d up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals; The skill of Artifice or Office mean, Not that which justly gives Heroic name To Person or to Poem. Mee of these Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise That name, unless an age too late, or cold Climat, or Years damp my intended wing Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine, Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear. The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round: When Satan who late fled before the threats Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv&amp;#39;d In meditated fraud and malice, bent On mans destruction, maugre what might hap Of heavier on himself, fearless return&amp;#39;d. By Night he fled, and at Midnight return&amp;#39;d From compassing the Earth, cautious of day, Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descri&amp;#39;d His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv&amp;#39;n, The space of seven continu&amp;#39;d Nights he rode With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line He circl&amp;#39;d, four times cross&amp;#39;d the Carr of Night From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure; On the eighth return&amp;#39;d, and on the Coast averse From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth Found unsuspected way. There was a place, Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change, Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life; In with the River sunk, and with it rose Satan involv&amp;#39;d in rising Mist, then sought Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole Maotis, up beyond the River Ob; Downward as farr Antartic; and in length West from Orontes to the Ocean barr&amp;#39;d At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes Ganges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam&amp;#39;d With narrow search; and with inspection deep Consider&amp;#39;d every Creature, which of all Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field. Him after long debate, irresolute Of thoughts revolv&amp;#39;d, his final sentence chose Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom To enter, and his dark suggestions hide From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake, Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, As from his wit and native suttletie Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ&amp;#39;d Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow&amp;#39;r Active within beyond the sense of brute. Thus he resolv&amp;#39;d, but first from inward griefe His bursting passion into plaints thus pour&amp;#39;d: O Earth, how like to Heav&amp;#39;n, if not preferr&amp;#39;d More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built With second thoughts, reforming what was old! For what God after better worse would build? Terrestrial Heav&amp;#39;n, danc&amp;#39;t round by other Heav&amp;#39;ns That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, In thee concentring all thir precious beams Of sacred influence: As God in Heav&amp;#39;n Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou Centring receav&amp;#39;st from all those Orbs; in thee, Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth Of Creatures animate with gradual life Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ&amp;#39;d up in Man. With what delight could I have walkt thee round, If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange Of Hill, and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines, Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Forrest crownd, Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these Find place or refuge; and the more I see Pleasures about me, so much more I feel Torment within me, as from the hateful siege Of contraries; all good to me becomes Bane, and in Heav&amp;#39;n much worse would be my state. But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav&amp;#39;n To dwell, unless by maistring Heav&amp;#39;ns Supreame; Nor hope to be my self less miserable By what I seek, but others to make such As I, though thereby worse to me redound: For onely in destroying I find ease To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, Or won to what may work his utter loss, For whom all this was made, all this will soon Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, In wo then; that destruction wide may range: To mee shall be the glorie sole among The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr&amp;#39;d What he Almightie styl&amp;#39;d, six Nights and Days Continu&amp;#39;d making, and who knows how long Before had bin contriving, though perhaps Not longer then since I in one Night freed From servitude inglorious welnigh half Th&amp;#39; Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng Of his adorers: hee to be aveng&amp;#39;d, And to repaire his numbers thus impair&amp;#39;d, Whether such vertue spent of old now faild More Angels to Create, if they at least Are his Created, or to spite us more, Determin&amp;#39;d to advance into our room A Creature form&amp;#39;d of Earth, and him endow, Exalted from so base original, With Heav&amp;#39;nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed He effected; Man he made, and for him built Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, Him Lord pronounc&amp;#39;d, and, O indignitie! Subjected to his service Angel wings, And flaming Ministers to watch and tend Thir earthy Charge: Of these the vigilance I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. O foul descent! that I who erst contended With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime, This essence to incarnate and imbrute, That to the hight of Deitie aspir&amp;#39;d; But what will not Ambition and Revenge Descend to? who aspires must down as low As high he soard, obnoxious first or last To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet, Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim&amp;#39;d, Since higher I fall short, on him who next Provokes my envie, this new Favorite Of Heav&amp;#39;n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais&amp;#39;d From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie, Like a black mist low creeping, he held on His midnight search, where soonest he might finde The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld, His head the midst, well stor&amp;#39;d with suttle wiles: Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den, Nor nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense, In heart or head, possessing soon inspir&amp;#39;d With act intelligential, but his sleep Disturbd not, waiting close th&amp;#39; approach of Morn. Now when as sacred Light began to dawne In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd Thir morning incense, when all things that breath, From th&amp;#39; Earths great Altar send up silent praise To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair And joind thir vocal Worship to the Quire Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: Then commune how that day they best may ply Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. And Eve first to her Husband thus began. Adam, well may we labour still to dress This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour, Our pleasant task enjoyn&amp;#39;d, but till more hands Aid us, the work under our labour grows, Luxurious by restraint; what we by day Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, One night or two with wanton growth derides Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise Or hear what to my minde first thoughts present, Let us divide our labours, thou where choice Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: For while so near each other thus all day Our taske we choose, what wonder if so near Looks intervene and smiles, or object new Casual discourse draw on, which intermits Our dayes work brought to little, though begun Early, and th&amp;#39; hour of Supper comes unearn&amp;#39;d. To whom mild answer Adam thus return&amp;#39;d. Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond Compare above all living Creatures deare, Well hast thou motion&amp;#39;d, well thy thoughts imployd How we might best fulfill the work which here God hath assign&amp;#39;d us, nor of me shalt pass Unprais&amp;#39;d: for nothing lovelier can be found In Woman, then to studie houshold good, And good workes in her Husband to promote. Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos&amp;#39;d Labour, as to debarr us when we need Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, To brute deni&amp;#39;d, and are of Love the food, Love not the lowest end of human life. For not to irksom toile, but to delight He made us, and delight to Reason joyn&amp;#39;d. These paths &amp;amp; Bowers doubt not but our joynt hands Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide As we need walk, till younger hands ere long Assist us: But if much converse perhaps Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield. For solitude somtimes is best societie, And short retirement urges sweet returne. But other doubt possesses me, least harm Befall thee sever&amp;#39;d from me; for thou knowst What hath bin warn&amp;#39;d us, what malicious Foe Envying our happiness, and of his own Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find His wish and best advantage, us asunder, Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each To other speedie aide might lend at need; Whether his first design be to withdraw Our fealtie from God, or to disturb Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss Enjoy&amp;#39;d by us excites his envie more; Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects. The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, With sweet austeer composure thus reply&amp;#39;d, Ofspring of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, That such an Enemie we have, who seeks Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, And from the parting Angel over-heard As in a shadie nook I stood behind, Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. But that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt To God or thee, because we have a foe May tempt it, I expected not to hear. His violence thou fearst not, being such, As wee, not capable of death or paine, Can either not receave, or can repell. His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love Can by his fraud be shak&amp;#39;n or seduc&amp;#39;t; Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brest Adam, missthought of her to thee so dear? To whom with healing words Adam replyd. Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: Not diffident of thee do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid Th&amp;#39; attempt it self, intended by our Foe. For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos&amp;#39;d Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne And anger wouldst resent the offer&amp;#39;d wrong, Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, If such affront I labour to avert From thee alone, which on us both at once The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, Or daring, first on mee th&amp;#39; assault shall light. Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. I from the influence of thy looks receave Access in every Vertue, in thy sight More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, Shame to be overcome or over-reacht Would utmost vigor raise, and rais&amp;#39;d unite. Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel When I am present, and thy trial choose With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri&amp;#39;d. So spake domestick Adam in his care And Matrimonial Love; but Eve, who thought Less attributed to her Faith sincere, Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. If this be our condition, thus to dwell In narrow circuit strait&amp;#39;nd by a Foe, Suttle or violent, we not endu&amp;#39;d Single with like defence, wherever met, How are we happie, still in fear of harm? But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integritie: his foul esteeme Sticks no dishonour on our Front, but turns Foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard By us? who rather double honour gaine From his surmise prov&amp;#39;d false, find peace within, Favour from Heav&amp;#39;n, our witness from th&amp;#39; event. And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid Alone, without exterior help sustaind? Let us not then suspect our happie State Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, As not secure to single or combin&amp;#39;d. Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, And Eden were no Eden thus expos&amp;#39;d. To whom thus Adam fervently repli&amp;#39;d. O Woman, best are all things as the will Of God ordain&amp;#39;d them, his creating hand Nothing imperfet or deficient left Of all that he Created, much less Man, Or aught that might his happie State secure, Secure from outward force; within himself The danger lies, yet lies within his power: Against his will he can receave no harme. But God left free the Will, for what obeyes Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, But bid her well beware, and still erect, Least by some faire appeering good surpris&amp;#39;d She dictate false, and misinforme the Will To do what God expressly hath forbid. Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, Since Reason not impossibly may meet Some specious object by the Foe subornd, And fall into deception unaware, Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. Seek not temptation then, which to avoide Were better, and most likelie if from mee Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought. Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve First thy obedience; th&amp;#39; other who can know, Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? But if thou think, trial unsought may finde Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; Go in thy native innocence, relie On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli&amp;#39;d. With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar&amp;#39;d, The willinger I goe, nor much expect A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light Oread or Dryad, or of Delia&amp;#39;s Traine, Betook her to the Groves, but Delia&amp;#39;s self In gate surpass&amp;#39;d and Goddess-like deport, Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, But with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude, Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought. To Pales, or Pomona thus adornd, Likeliest she seemd, Pomona when she fled Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu&amp;#39;d Delighted, but desiring more her stay. Oft he to her his charge of quick returne Repeated, shee to him as oft engag&amp;#39;d To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, And all things in best order to invite Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. O much deceav&amp;#39;d, much failing, hapless Eve, Of thy presum&amp;#39;d return! event perverse! Thou never from that houre in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades Waited with hellish rancour imminent To intercept thy way, or send thee back Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde The onely two of Mankinde, but in them The whole included Race, his purposd prey. In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet He sought them both, but wish&amp;#39;d his hap might find Eve separate, he wish&amp;#39;d, but not with hope Of what so seldom chanc&amp;#39;d, when to his wish, Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, Half spi&amp;#39;d, so thick the Roses bushing round About her glowd, oft stooping to support Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers&amp;#39;d Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen Among thick-wov&amp;#39;n Arborets and Flours Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign&amp;#39;d Or of reviv&amp;#39;d Adonis, or renownd Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. Much hee the Place admir&amp;#39;d, the Person more. As one who long in populous City pent, Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, She most, and in her look summs all Delight. Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav&amp;#39;nly forme Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire Of gesture or lest action overawd His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav&amp;#39;d His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: That space the Evil one abstracted stood From his own evil, and for the time remaind Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm&amp;#39;d, Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, Though in mid Heav&amp;#39;n, soon ended his delight, And tortures him now more, the more he sees Of pleasure not for him ordain&amp;#39;d: then soon Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet Compulsion thus transported to forget What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, Save what is in destroying, other joy To me is lost. Then let me not let pass Occasion which now smiles, behold alone The Woman, opportune to all attempts, Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, Whose higher intellectual more I shun, And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, I not; so much hath Hell debas&amp;#39;d, and paine Infeebl&amp;#39;d me, to what I was in Heav&amp;#39;n. Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, Not terrible, though terrour be in Love And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign&amp;#39;d, The way which to her ruin now I tend. So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos&amp;#39;d In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve Address&amp;#39;d his way, not with indented wave, Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, Circular base of rising foulds, that tour&amp;#39;d Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, And lovely, never since of Serpent kind Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang&amp;#39;d Hermione and Cadmus, or the God In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique At first, as one who sought access, but feard To interrupt, side-long he works his way. As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us&amp;#39;d To such disport before her through the Field, From every Beast, more duteous at her call, Then at Circean call the Herd disguis&amp;#39;d. Hee boulder now, uncall&amp;#39;d before her stood; But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd His turret Crest, and sleek enamel&amp;#39;d Neck, Fawning, and lick&amp;#39;d the ground whereon she trod. His gentle dumb expression turnd at length The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, His fraudulent temptation thus began. Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm Thy looks, the Heav&amp;#39;n of mildness, with disdain, Displeas&amp;#39;d that I approach thee thus, and gaze Insatiate, I thus single, nor have feard Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir&amp;#39;d. Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore With ravishment beheld, there best beheld Where universally admir&amp;#39;d; but here In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne Half what in thee is fair, one man except, Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen A Goddess among Gods, ador&amp;#39;d and serv&amp;#39;d By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. So gloz&amp;#39;d the Tempter, and his Proem tun&amp;#39;d; Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, Though at the voice much marveling; at length Not unamaz&amp;#39;d she thus in answer spake. What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc&amp;#39;t By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? The first at lest of these I thought deni&amp;#39;d To Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-Day Created mute to all articulat sound; The latter I demurre, for in thir looks Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field I knew, but not with human voice endu&amp;#39;d; Redouble then this miracle, and say, How cam&amp;#39;st thou speakable of mute, and how To me so friendly grown above the rest Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? Say, for such wonder claims attention due. To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply&amp;#39;d. Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, Easie to mee it is to tell thee all What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: I was at first as other Beasts that graze The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, As was my food, nor aught but food discern&amp;#39;d Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc&amp;#39;d A goodly Tree farr distant to behold Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; When from the boughes a savorie odour blow&amp;#39;n, Grateful to appetite, more pleas&amp;#39;d my sense Then smell of sweetest Fenel or the Teats Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. To satisfie the sharp desire I had Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv&amp;#39;d Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, Powerful perswaders, quick&amp;#39;nd at the scent Of that alluring fruit, urg&amp;#39;d me so keene. About the mossie Trunk I wound me soon, For high from ground the branches would require Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree All other Beasts that saw, with like desire Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. Amid the Tree now got, where plenty hung Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill I spar&amp;#39;d not, for such pleasure till that hour At Feed or Fountain never had I found. Sated at length, ere long I might perceave Strange alteration in me, to degree Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech Wanted not long, though to this shape retain&amp;#39;d. Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind Considerd all things visible in Heav&amp;#39;n, Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; But all that fair and good in thy Divine Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav&amp;#39;nly Ray United I beheld; no Fair to thine Equivalent or second, which compel&amp;#39;d Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come And gaze, and worship thee of right declar&amp;#39;d Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. So talk&amp;#39;d the spirited sly Snake; and Eve Yet more amaz&amp;#39;d unwarie thus reply&amp;#39;d. Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov&amp;#39;d: But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? For many are the Trees of God that grow In Paradise, and various, yet unknown To us, in such aboundance lies our choice, As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, Still hanging incorruptible, till men Grow up to thir provision, and more hands Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. Empress, the way is readie, and not long, Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld In tangles, and made intricate seem strait, To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy Bright&amp;#39;ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire, Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night Condenses, and the cold invirons round, Kindl&amp;#39;d through agitation to a Flame, Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, Misleads th&amp;#39; amaz&amp;#39;d Night-wanderer from his way To Boggs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Poole, There swallow&amp;#39;d up and lost, from succour farr. So glister&amp;#39;d the dire Snake, and into fraud Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree Of prohibition, root of all our woe; Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. Serpent, we might have spar&amp;#39;d our coming hither, Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess, The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; God so commanded, and left that Command Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. To whom the Tempter guilefully repli&amp;#39;d. Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, Yet Lords declar&amp;#39;d of all in Earth or Aire? To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love To Man, and indignation at his wrong, New part puts on, and as to passion mov&amp;#39;d, Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act Rais&amp;#39;d, as of som great matter to begin. As when of old som Orator renound In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, Stood in himself collected, while each part, Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, Somtimes in highth began, as no delay Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown The Tempter all impassiond thus began. O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power Within me cleere, not onely to discerne Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. Queen of this Universe, doe not believe Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, Mee who have touch&amp;#39;d and tasted, yet both live, And life more perfet have attaind then Fate Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast Is open? or will God incense his ire For such a petty Trespass, and not praise Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain Of Death denounc&amp;#39;t, whatever thing Death be, Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeyd: Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, His worshippers; he knows that in the day Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then Op&amp;#39;nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, Internal Man, is but proportion meet, I of brute human, yee of human Gods. So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, Though threat&amp;#39;nd, which no worse then this can bring. And what are Gods that Man may not become As they, participating God-like food? The Gods are first, and that advantage use On our belief, that all from them proceeds; I question it, for this fair Earth I see, Warm&amp;#39;d by the Sun, producing every kind, Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos&amp;#39;d Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies Th&amp;#39; offence, that Man should thus attain to know? What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree Impart against his will if all be his? Or is it envie, and can envie dwell In heav&amp;#39;nly breasts? these, these and many more Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. He ended, and his words replete with guile Into her heart too easie entrance won: Fixt on the Fruit she gaz&amp;#39;d, which to behold Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn&amp;#39;d With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; Mean while the hour of Noon drew on, and wak&amp;#39;d An eager appetite, rais&amp;#39;d by the smell So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, Sollicited her longing eye; yet first Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus&amp;#39;d. Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admir&amp;#39;d, Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay Gave elocution to the mute, and taught The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good By thee communicated, and our want: For good unknown, sure is not had, or had And yet unknown, is as not had at all. In plain then, what forbids he but to know, Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death Bind us with after-bands, what profits then Our inward freedom? In the day we eate Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat&amp;#39;n and lives, And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, Irrational till then. For us alone Was death invented? or to us deni&amp;#39;d This intellectual food, for beasts reserv&amp;#39;d? For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy The good befall&amp;#39;n him, Author unsuspect, Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. What fear I then, rather what know to feare Under this ignorance of good and Evil, Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? So saying, her rash hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck&amp;#39;d, she eat: Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, In Fruit she never tasted, whether true Or fansied so, through expectation high Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. Greedily she ingorg&amp;#39;d without restraint, And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, And hight&amp;#39;nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, Thus to her self she pleasingly began. O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees In Paradise, of operation blest To Sapience, hitherto obscur&amp;#39;d, infam&amp;#39;d, And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end Created; but henceforth my early care, Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease Of thy full branches offer&amp;#39;d free to all; Till dieted by thee I grow mature In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; Though others envie what they cannot give; For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind In ignorance, thou op&amp;#39;nst Wisdoms way, And giv&amp;#39;st access, though secret she retire. And I perhaps am secret; Heav&amp;#39;n is high, High and remote to see from thence distinct Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps May have diverted from continual watch Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies About him. But to Adam in what sort Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known As yet my change, and give him to partake Full happiness with mee, or rather not, But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power Without Copartner? so to add what wants In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, And render me more equal, and perhaps, A thing not undesireable, somtime Superior; for inferior who is free? This may be well: but what if God have seen, And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, And Adam wedded to another Eve, Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; A death to think. Confirm&amp;#39;d then I resolve; Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: So dear I love him, that with him all deaths I could endure, without him live no life. So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, But first low Reverence don, as to the power That dwelt within, whose presence had infus&amp;#39;d Into the plant sciential sap, deriv&amp;#39;d From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while Waiting desirous her return, had wove Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown, As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. Great joy he promis&amp;#39;d to his thoughts, and new Solace in her return, so long delay&amp;#39;d; Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; And forth to meet her went, the way she took That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil&amp;#39;d, New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus&amp;#39;d. To him she hasted, in her face excuse Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv&amp;#39;d Thy presence, agonie of love till now Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more Mean I to trie, what rash untri&amp;#39;d I sought, The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown Op&amp;#39;ning the way, but of Divine effect To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; And hath bin tasted such: the Serpent wise, Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, Hath eat&amp;#39;n of the fruit, and is become, Not dead, as we are threatn&amp;#39;d, but thenceforth Endu&amp;#39;d with human voice and human sense, Reasoning to admiration, and with mee Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I Have also tasted, and have also found Th&amp;#39; effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, And growing up to Godhead; which for thee Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, Tedious, unshar&amp;#39;d with thee, and odious soon. Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot May joyne us, equal joy, as equal Love; Least thou not tasting, different degree Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. On th&amp;#39; other side, Adam, soon as he heard The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz&amp;#39;d, Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax&amp;#39;d; From his slack hand the Garland wreath&amp;#39;d for Eve Down drop&amp;#39;d, and all the faded Roses shed: Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length First to himself he inward silence broke. O fairest of Creation, last and best Of all Gods works, Creature in whom excell&amp;#39;d Whatever can to sight or thought be formd, Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, Defac&amp;#39;t, deflourd, and now to Death devote? Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress The strict forbiddance, how to violate The sacred Fruit forbidd&amp;#39;n! som cursed fraud Of Enemie hath beguil&amp;#39;d thee, yet unknown, And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee Certain my resolution is to Die; How can I live without thee, how forgoe Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn&amp;#39;d, To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? Should God create another Eve, and I Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee Would never from my heart; no no, I feel The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. So having said, as one from sad dismay Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd Submitting to what seemd remediless, Thus in calm mood his Words to Eve he turnd. Bold deed thou hast presum&amp;#39;d, adventrous Eve, And peril great provok&amp;#39;t, who thus hath dar&amp;#39;d Had it been onely coveting to Eye That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, Much more to taste it under banne to touch. But past who can recall, or don undoe? Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate, yet so Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, Profan&amp;#39;d first by the Serpent, by him first Made common and unhallowd ere our taste; Nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives, Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man Higher degree of Life, inducement strong To us, as likely tasting to attaine Proportional ascent, which cannot be But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy Us his prime Creatures, dignifi&amp;#39;d so high, Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, For us created, needs with us must faile, Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, Not well conceav&amp;#39;d of God, who though his Power Creation could repeate, yet would be loath Us to abolish, least the Adversary Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God Most Favors, who can please him long; Mee first He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe, However I with thee have fixt my Lot, Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; So forcible within my heart I feel The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; Our State cannot be severd, we are one, One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli&amp;#39;d. O glorious trial of exceeding Love, Illustrious evidence, example high! Ingaging me to emulate, but short Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, Direct, or by occasion hath presented This happie trial of thy Love, which else So eminently never had bin known. Were it I thought Death menac&amp;#39;t would ensue This my attempt, I would sustain alone The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur&amp;#39;d Remarkably so late of thy so true, So faithful Love unequald; but I feel Farr otherwise th&amp;#39; event, not Death, but Life Augmented, op&amp;#39;nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. On my experience, Adam, freely taste, And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. So saying, she embrac&amp;#39;d him, and for joy Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love Had so enobl&amp;#39;d, as of choice to incurr Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. In recompence (for such compliance bad Such recompence best merits) from the bough She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit With liberal hand: he scrupl&amp;#39;d not to eat Against his better knowledge, not deceav&amp;#39;d, But fondly overcome with Femal charm. Earth trembl&amp;#39;d from her entrails, as again In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, Skie lowr&amp;#39;d and muttering Thunder, som sad drops Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin Original; while Adam took no thought, Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate Her former trespass fear&amp;#39;d, the more to soothe Him with her lov&amp;#39;d societie, that now As with new Wine intoxicated both They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel Divinitie within them breeding wings Wherewith to scorne the Earth: but that false Fruit Farr other operation first displaid, Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: Till Adam thus&amp;#39;gan Eve to dalliance move, Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, And elegant, of Sapience no small part, Since to each meaning savour we apply, And Palate call judicious; I the praise Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey&amp;#39;d. Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain&amp;#39;d From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be In things to us forbidden, it might be wish&amp;#39;d, For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. But come, so well refresh&amp;#39;t, now let us play, As meet is, after such delicious Fare; For never did thy Beautie since the day I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn&amp;#39;d With all perfections, so enflame my sense With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. So said he, and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent, well understood Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. Her hand he seis&amp;#39;d, and to a shadie bank, Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr&amp;#39;d He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep Oppress&amp;#39;d them, wearied with thir amorous play. Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, That with exhilerating vapour bland About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers Made erre, was now exhal&amp;#39;d, and grosser sleep Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose As from unrest, and each the other viewing, Soon found thir Eyes how op&amp;#39;nd, and thir minds How dark&amp;#39;nd; innocence, that as a veile Had shadow&amp;#39;d them from knowing ill, was gon, Just confidence, and native righteousness And honour from about them, naked left To guiltie shame hee cover&amp;#39;d, but his Robe Uncover&amp;#39;d more, so rose the Danite strong Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak&amp;#39;d Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face Confounded long they sate, as struck&amp;#39;n mute, Till Adam, though not less then Eve abash&amp;#39;t, At length gave utterance to these words constraind. Eve, in evil hour thou didst give eare To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, False in our promis&amp;#39;d Rising; since our Eyes Op&amp;#39;nd we find indeed, and find we know Both Good and Evil, Good lost, and Evil got, Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, And in our Faces evident the signes Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; Even shame, the last of evils; of the first Be sure then. How shall I behold the face Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy And rapture so oft beheld? those heav&amp;#39;nly shapes Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze Insufferably bright. O might I here In solitude live savage, in some glade Obscur&amp;#39;d, where highest Woods impenetrable To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs Hide me, where I may never see them more. But let us now, as in bad plight, devise What best may from the present serve to hide The Parts of each for other, that seem most To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, And girded on our loyns, may cover round Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. So counsel&amp;#39;d hee, and both together went Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown&amp;#39;d, But such as at this day to Indians known In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade High overarch&amp;#39;t, and echoing Walks between; There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, And with what skill they had, together sowd, To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike To that first naked Glorie. Such of late Columbus found th&amp;#39; American so girt With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. Thus fenc&amp;#39;t, and as they thought, thir shame in part Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore Thir inward State of Mind, calm Region once And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: For Understanding rul&amp;#39;d not, and the Will Heard not her lore, both in subjection now To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe Usurping over sovran Reason claimd Superior sway: from thus distemperd brest, Adam, estrang&amp;#39;d in look and alterd stile, Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. Would thou hadst heark&amp;#39;nd to my words, and stai&amp;#39;d With me, as I besought thee, when that strange Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, I know not whence possessd thee; we had then Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild Of all our good, sham&amp;#39;d, naked, miserable. Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. To whom soon mov&amp;#39;d with touch of blame thus Eve. What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, Imput&amp;#39;st thou that to my default, or will Of wandring, as thou call&amp;#39;st it, which who knows But might as ill have happ&amp;#39;nd thou being by, Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou been there, Or here th&amp;#39; attempt, thou couldst not have discernd Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; No ground of enmitie between us known, Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme, Was I to have never parted from thy side? As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head Command me absolutely not to go, Going into such danger as thou saidst? Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, Nay didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, Neither had I transgress&amp;#39;d, nor thou with mee. To whom then first incenst Adam repli&amp;#39;d, Is this the Love, is this the recompence Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, Who might have liv&amp;#39;d and joyd immortal bliss, Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: And am I now upbraided, as the cause Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? I warn&amp;#39;d thee, I admonish&amp;#39;d thee, foretold The danger, and the lurking Enemie That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, And force upon free will hath here no place. But confidence then bore thee on, secure Either to meet no danger, or to finde Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps I also err&amp;#39;d in overmuch admiring What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue That errour now, which is become my crime, And thou th&amp;#39; accuser. Thus it shall befall Him who to worth in Women overtrusting Lets her will rule; restraint she will not brook, And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. Thus they in mutual accusation spent The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning, And of thir vain contest appeer&amp;#39;d no end.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I Who e&amp;#39;re while the happy Garden sung, By one mans disobedience lost, now sing Recover&amp;#39;d Paradise to all mankind, By one mans firm obedience fully tri&amp;#39;d Through all temptation, and the Tempter foil&amp;#39;d In all his wiles, defeated and repuls&amp;#39;t, And Eden rais&amp;#39;d in the wast Wilderness. Thou Spirit who ledst this glorious Eremite Into the Desert, his Victorious Field Against the Spiritual Foe, and broughtst him thence By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire, As thou art wont, my prompted Song else mute, And bear through highth or depth of natures bounds With prosperous wing full summ&amp;#39;d to tell of deeds Above Heroic, though in secret done, And unrecorded left through many an Age, Worthy t&amp;#39;have not remain&amp;#39;d so long unsung. Now had the great Proclaimer with a voice More awful then the sound of Trumpet, cri&amp;#39;d Repentance, and Heavens Kingdom nigh at hand To all Baptiz&amp;#39;d: to his great Baptism flock&amp;#39;d With aw the Regions round, and with them came From Nazareth the Son of Joseph deem&amp;#39;d To the flood Jordan, came as then obscure, Unmarkt, unknown; but him the Baptist soon Descri&amp;#39;d, divinely warn&amp;#39;d, and witness bore As to his worthier, and would have resign&amp;#39;d To him his Heavenly Office, nor was long His witness unconfirm&amp;#39;d: on him baptiz&amp;#39;d Heaven open&amp;#39;d, and in likeness of a Dove The Spirit descended, while the Fathers voice From Heav&amp;#39;n pronounc&amp;#39;d him his beloved Son. That heard the Adversary, who roving still About the world, at that assembly fam&amp;#39;d Would not be last, and with the voice divine Nigh Thunder-struck, th&amp;#39; exalted man, to whom Such high attest was giv&amp;#39;n, a while survey&amp;#39;d With wonder, then with envy fraught and rage Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air To Councel summons all his mighty Peers, Within thick Clouds and dark ten-fold involv&amp;#39;d, A gloomy Consistory; and them amidst With looks agast and sad he thus bespake. O ancient Powers of Air and this wide world, For much more willingly I mention Air, This our old Conquest, then remember Hell Our hated habitation; well ye know How many Ages, as the years of men, This Universe we have possest, and rul&amp;#39;d In manner at our will th&amp;#39; affairs of Earth, Since Adam and his facil consort Eve Lost Paradise deceiv&amp;#39;d by me, though since With dread attending when that fatal wound Shall be inflicted by the Seed of Eve Upon my head, long the decrees of Heav&amp;#39;n Delay, for longest time to him is short; And now too soon for us the circling hours This dreaded time have compast, wherein we Must bide the stroak of that long threatn&amp;#39;d wound, At least if so we can, and by the head Broken be not intended all our power To be infring&amp;#39;d, our freedom and our being. In this fair Empire won of Earth and Air; For this ill news I bring, the Womans seed Destin&amp;#39;d to this, is late of woman born, His birth to our just fear gave no small cause, But his growth now to youths full flowr, displaying All vertue, grace and wisdom to atchieve Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear. Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim His coming, is sent Harbinger, who all Invites, and in the Consecrated stream Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so Purified to receive him pure, or rather To do him honour as their King; all come, And he himself among them was baptiz&amp;#39;d, Not thence to be more pure, but to receive The testimony of Heaven, that who he is Thenceforth the Nations may not doubt; I saw The Prophet do him reverence, on him rising Out of the water, Heav&amp;#39;n above the Clouds Unfold her Crystal Dores, thence on his head A perfect Dove descend, what e&amp;#39;re it meant, And out of Heav&amp;#39;n the Sov&amp;#39;raign voice I heard, This is my Son belov&amp;#39;d, in him am pleas&amp;#39;d. His Mother then is mortal, but his Sire, He who obtains the Monarchy of Heav&amp;#39;n, And what will he not do to advance his Son? His first-begot we know, and sore have felt, When his fierce thunder drove us to the deep; Who this is we must learn, for man he seems In all his lineaments, though in his face The glimpses of his Fathers glory shine. Ye see our danger on the utmost edge Of hazard, which admits no long debate, But must with something sudden be oppos&amp;#39;d, Not force, but well couch&amp;#39;t fraud, well woven snares, E&amp;#39;re in the head of Nations he appear Their King, their Leader, and Supream on Earth. I, when no other durst, sole undertook The dismal expedition to find out And ruine Adam, and the exploit perform&amp;#39;d Successfully; a calmer voyage now Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once Induces best to hope of like success. He ended, and his words impression left Of much amazement to th&amp;#39; infernal Crew, Distracted and surpriz&amp;#39;d with deep dismay At these sad tidings; but no time was then For long indulgence to their fears or grief: Unanimous they all commit the care And management of this main enterprize To him their great Dictator, whose attempt At first against mankind so well had thriv&amp;#39;d In Adam&amp;#39;s overthrow, and led thir march From Hell&amp;#39;s deep-vaulted Den to dwell in light, Regents and Potentates, and Kings, yea gods Of many a pleasant Realm and Province wide. So to the Coast of Jordan he directs His easie steps; girded with snaky wiles, Where he might likeliest find this new-declar&amp;#39;d, This man of men, attested Son of God, Temptation and all guile on him to try; So to subvert whom he suspected rais&amp;#39;d To end his Raign on Earth so long enjoy&amp;#39;d: But contrary unweeting he fulfill&amp;#39;d The purpos&amp;#39;d Counsel pre-ordain&amp;#39;d and fixt Of the most High, who in full frequence bright Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake. Gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold, Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth With man or mens affairs, how I begin To verifie that solemn message late, On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure In Galilee, that she should bear a Son Great in Renown, and call&amp;#39;d the Son of God; Then toldst her doubting how these things could be To her a Virgin, that on her should come The Holy Ghost, and the power of the highest O&amp;#39;re-shadow her: this man born and now up-grown, To shew him worthy of his birth divine And high prediction, henceforth I expose To Satan; let him tempt and now assay His utmost subtilty, because he boasts And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng Of his Apostasie; he might have learnt Less over-weening, since he fail&amp;#39;d in Job, Whose constant perseverance overcame Whate&amp;#39;re his cruel malice could invent. He now shall know I can produce a man Of female Seed, far abler to resist All his sollicitations, and at length All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell, Winning by Conquest what the first man lost By fallacy surpriz&amp;#39;d. But first I mean To exercise him in the Wilderness, There he shall first lay down the rudiments Of his great warfare, e&amp;#39;re I send him forth To conquer Sin and Death the two grand foes, By Humiliation and strong Sufferance: His weakness shall o&amp;#39;recome Satanic strength And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; That all the Angels and Ætherial Powers, They now, and men hereafter may discern, From what consummate vertue I have chose This perfect Man, by merit call&amp;#39;d my Son, To earn Salvation for the Sons of men. So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven Admiring stood a space, then into Hymns Burst forth, and in Celestial measures mov&amp;#39;d, Circling the Throne and Singing, while the hand Sung with the voice, and this the argument. Victory and Triumph to the Son of God Now entring his great duel, not of arms, But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles. The Father knows the Son; therefore secure Ventures his filial Vertue, though untri&amp;#39;d, Against whate&amp;#39;re may tempt, whate&amp;#39;re seduce, Allure, or terrifie, or undermine. Be frustrate all ye stratagems of Hell, And devilish machinations come to nought. So they in Heav&amp;#39;n their Odes and Vigils tun&amp;#39;d: Mean while the Son of God, who yet some days Lodg&amp;#39;d in Bethabara where John baptiz&amp;#39;d, Musing and much revolving in his brest, How best the mighty work he might begin Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first Publish his God-like office now mature, One day forth walk&amp;#39;d alone, the Spirit leading; And his deep thoughts, the better to converse With solitude, till far from track of men, Thought following thought, and step by step led on, He entred now the bordering Desert wild, And with dark shades and rocks environ&amp;#39;d round, His holy Meditations thus persu&amp;#39;d. O what a multitude of thoughts at once Awakn&amp;#39;d in me swarm, while I consider What from within I feel my self, and hear What from without comes often to my ears, Ill sorting with my present state compar&amp;#39;d. When I was yet a child, no childish play To me was pleasing, all my mind was set Serious to learn and know, and thence to do What might be publick good; my self I thought Born to that end, born to promote all truth, All righteous things: therefore above my years, The Law of God I read, and found it sweet, Made it my whole delight, and in it grew To such perfection, that e&amp;#39;re yet my age Had measur&amp;#39;d twice six years, at our great Feast I went into the Temple, there to hear The Teachers of our Law, and to propose What might improve my knowledge or their own; And was admir&amp;#39;d by all, yet this not all To which my Spirit aspir&amp;#39;d, victorious deeds Flam&amp;#39;d in my heart, heroic acts, one while To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke, Then to subdue and quell o&amp;#39;re all the earth Brute violence and proud Tyrannick pow&amp;#39;r, Till truth were freed, and equity restor&amp;#39;d: Yet held it more humane, more heavenly first By winning words to conquer willing hearts, And make perswasion do the work of fear; At least to try, and teach the erring Soul Not wilfully mis-doing, but unware Misled; the stubborn only to destroy. These growing thoughts my Mother soon perceiving By words at times cast forth inly rejoyc&amp;#39;d, And said to me apart, high are thy thoughts O Son, but nourish them and let them soar To what highth sacred vertue and true worth Can raise them, though above example high; By matchless Deeds express thy matchless Sire. For know, thou art no Son of mortal man, Though men esteem thee low of Parentage, Thy Father is the Eternal King, who rules All Heaven and Earth, Angels and Sons of men, A messenger from God fore-told thy birth Conceiv&amp;#39;d in me a Virgin, he fore-told Thou shouldst be great and sit on David&amp;#39;s Throne, And of thy Kingdom there should be no end. At thy Nativity a glorious Quire Of Angels in the fields of Bethlehem sung To Shepherds watching at their folds by night, And told them the Messiah now was born, Where they might see him, and to thee they came; Directed to the Manger where thou lais&amp;#39;t, For in the Inn was left no better room: A Star, not seen before in Heaven appearing Guided the Wise Men thither from the East, To honour thee with Incense, Myrrh, and Gold, By whose bright course led on they found the place, Affirming it thy Star new grav&amp;#39;n in Heaven, By which they knew thee King of Israel born. Just Simeon and Prophetic Anna, warn&amp;#39;d By Vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake Before the Altar and the vested Priest, Like things of thee to all that present stood. This having heard, strait I again revolv&amp;#39;d The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ Concerning the Messiah, to our Scribes Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake I am; this chiefly, that my way must lie Through many a hard assay even to the death, E&amp;#39;re I the promis&amp;#39;d Kingdom can attain, Or work Redemption for mankind, whose sins Full weight must be transferr&amp;#39;d upon my head. Yet neither thus disheartn&amp;#39;d or dismay&amp;#39;d, The time prefixt I waited, when behold The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard, Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come Before Messiah and his way prepare. I as all others to his Baptism came, Which I believ&amp;#39;d was from above; but he Strait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim&amp;#39;d Me him (for it was shew&amp;#39;n him so from Heaven) Me him whose Harbinger he was; and first Refus&amp;#39;d on me his Baptism to confer, As much his greater, and was hardly won; But as I rose out of the laving stream, Heaven open&amp;#39;d her eternal doors, from whence The Spirit descended on me like a Dove, And last the sum of all, my Father&amp;#39;s voice, Audibly heard from Heav&amp;#39;n, pronounc&amp;#39;d me his, Me his beloved Son, in whom alone He was well pleas&amp;#39;d; by which I knew the time Now full, that I no more should live obscure, But openly begin, as best becomes The Authority which I deriv&amp;#39;d from Heaven. And now by some strong motion I am led Into this Wilderness, to what intent I learn not yet, perhaps I need not know; For what concerns my knowledge God reveals. So spake our Morning Star then in his rise, And looking round on every side beheld A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades; The way he came not having mark&amp;#39;d, return Was difficult, by humane steps untrod; And he still on was led, but with such thoughts Accompanied of things past and to come Lodg&amp;#39;d in his breast, as well might recommend Such Solitude before choicest Society. Full forty days he pass&amp;#39;d, whether on hill Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night Under the covert of some ancient Oak, Or Cedar, to defend him from the dew, Or harbour&amp;#39;d in one Cave, is not reveal&amp;#39;d; Nor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt Till those days ended, hunger&amp;#39;d then at last Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild, Nor sleeping him nor waking harm&amp;#39;d, his walk The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm, The Lion and fierce Tiger glar&amp;#39;d aloof. But now an aged man in Rural weeds, Following, as seem&amp;#39;d, the quest of some stray Ewe, Or wither&amp;#39;d sticks to gather; which might serve Against a Winters day when winds blow keen, To warm him wet return&amp;#39;d from field at Eve, He saw approach, who first with curious eye Perus&amp;#39;d him, then with words thus utt&amp;#39;red spake. Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place So far from path or road of men, who pass In Troop or Caravan, for single none Durst ever, who return&amp;#39;d, and dropt not here His Carcass, pin&amp;#39;d with hunger and with droughth? I ask the rather, and the more admire, For that to me thou seem&amp;#39;st the man, whom late Our new baptizing Prophet at the Ford Of Jordan honour&amp;#39;d so, and call&amp;#39;d thee Son Of God; I saw and heard, for we sometimes Who dwell this wild, constrain&amp;#39;d by want, come forth To Town or Village nigh (nighest is far) Where ought we hear, and curious are to hear, What happ&amp;#39;ns new; Fame also finds us out. To whom the Son of God. Who brought me hither Will bring me hence, no other Guide I seek. By Miracle he may, reply&amp;#39;d the Swain, What other way I see not, for we here Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur&amp;#39;d More then the Camel, and to drink go far, Men to much misery and hardship born; But if thou be the Son of God, Command That out of these hard stones be made thee bread; So shalt thou save thy self and us relieve With Food, whereof we wretched seldom taste. He ended, and the Son of God reply&amp;#39;d. Think&amp;#39;st thou such force in Bread? is it not written (For I discern thee other then thou seem&amp;#39;st) Man lives not by Bread only, but each Word Proceeding from the mouth of God; who fed Our Fathers here with Manna; in the Mount Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank, And forty days Eliah without food Wandred this barren waste, the same I now. Why dost thou then suggest to me distrust, Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art? Whom thus answer&amp;#39;d th&amp;#39; Arch Fiend now undisguis&amp;#39;d. &amp;#39;Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate, Who leagu&amp;#39;d with millions more in rash revolt Kept not my happy Station, but was driv&amp;#39;n With them from bliss to the bottomless deep, Yet to that hideous place not so confin&amp;#39;d By rigour unconniving, but that oft Leaving my dolorous Prison I enjoy Large liberty to round this Globe of Earth, Or range in th&amp;#39; Air, nor from the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heav&amp;#39;ns Hath he excluded my resort sometimes. I came among the Sons of God, when he Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job To prove him, and illustrate his high worth; And when to all his Angels he propos&amp;#39;d To draw the proud King Ahab into fraud That he might fall in Ramoth, they demuring, I undertook that office, and the tongues Of all his flattering Prophets glibb&amp;#39;d with lyes To his destruction, as I had in charge. For what he bids I do; though I have lost Much lustre of my native brightness, lost To be belov&amp;#39;d of God, I have not lost To love, at least contemplate and admire What I see excellent in good, or fair, Or vertuous, I should so have lost all sense. What can be then less in me then desire To see thee and approach thee, whom I know Declar&amp;#39;d the Son of God, to hear attent Thy wisdom, and behold thy God-like deeds? Men generally think me much a foe To all mankind: why should I? they to me Never did wrong or violence, by them I lost not what I lost, rather by them I gain&amp;#39;d what I have gain&amp;#39;d, and with them dwell Copartner in these Regions of the World, If not disposer; lend them oft my aid, Oft my advice by presages and signs, And answers, oracles, portents and dreams, Whereby they may direct their future life. Envy they say excites me, thus to gain Companions of my misery and wo. At first it may be; but long since with wo Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof, That fellowship in pain divides not smart, Nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load. Small consolation then, were Man adjoyn&amp;#39;d: This wounds me most (what can it less) that Man, Man fall&amp;#39;n shall be restor&amp;#39;d, I never more. To whom our Saviour sternly thus reply&amp;#39;d. Deservedly thou griev&amp;#39;st, compos&amp;#39;d of lyes From the beginning, and in lies wilt end; Who boast&amp;#39;st release from Hell, and leave to come Into the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heavens; thou com&amp;#39;st indeed, As a poor miserable captive thrall, Comes to the place where he before had sat Among the Prime in Splendour, now depos&amp;#39;d, Ejected, emptyed, gaz&amp;#39;d, unpityed, shun&amp;#39;d, A spectacle of ruin or of scorn To all the Host of Heaven; the happy place Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy, Rather inflames thy torment, representing Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable, So never more in Hell then when in Heaven. But thou art serviceable to Heaven&amp;#39;s King. Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? What but thy malice mov&amp;#39;d thee to misdeem Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him With all inflictions, but his patience won? The other service was thy chosen task, To be a lyer in four hundred mouths; For lying is thy sustenance, thy food. Yet thou pretend&amp;#39;st to truth; all Oracles By thee are giv&amp;#39;n, and what confest more true Among the Nations? that hath been thy craft, By mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes. But what have been thy answers, what but dark Ambiguous and with double sense deluding, Which they who ask&amp;#39;d have seldom understood, And not well understood as good not known? Who ever by consulting at thy shrine Return&amp;#39;d the wiser, or the more instruct To flye or follow what concern&amp;#39;d him most, And run not sooner to his fatal snare? For God hath justly giv&amp;#39;n the Nations up To thy Delusions; justly, since they fell Idolatrous, but when his purpose is Among them to declare his Providence To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, But from him or his Angels President In every Province, who themselves disdaining To approach thy Temples, give thee in command What to the smallest tittle thou shalt say To thy Adorers; thou with trembling fear, Or like a Fawning Parasite obey&amp;#39;st; Then to thy self ascrib&amp;#39;st the truth fore-told. But this thy glory shall be soon retrench&amp;#39;d; No more shalt thou by oracling abuse The Gentiles; henceforth Oracles are ceast, And thou no more with Pomp and Sacrifice Shalt be enquir&amp;#39;d at Delphos or elsewhere, At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. God hath now sent his living Oracle Into the World, to teach his final will, And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell In pious Hearts, an inward Oracle To all truth requisite for men to know. So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend, Though inly stung with anger and disdain, Dissembl&amp;#39;d, and this Answer smooth return&amp;#39;d. Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, And urg&amp;#39;d me hard with doings, which not will But misery hath rested from me; where Easily canst thou find one miserable, And not inforc&amp;#39;d oft-times to part from truth; If it may stand him more in stead to lye, Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? But thou art plac&amp;#39;t above me, thou art Lord; From thee I can and must submiss endure Check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, Smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th&amp;#39; ear, And tuneable as Silvan Pipe or Song; What wonder then if I delight to hear Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire Vertue, who follow not her lore: permit me To hear thee when I come (since no man comes) And talk at least, though I despair to attain. Thy Father, who is holy, wise and pure, Suffers the Hypocrite or Atheous Priest To tread his Sacred Courts, and minister About his Altar, handling holy things, Praying or vowing, and vouchsaf&amp;#39;d his voice To Balaam Reprobate, a Prophet yet Inspir&amp;#39;d; disdain not such access to me. To whom our Saviour with unalter&amp;#39;d brow. Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, I bid not or forbid; do as thou find&amp;#39;st Permission from above; thou canst not more. He added not; and Satan bowing low His gray dissimulation, disappear&amp;#39;d Into thin Air diffus&amp;#39;d: for now began Night with her sullen wing to double-shade The Desert, Fowls in thir clay nests were couch&amp;#39;t; And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;MEan while the new-baptiz&amp;#39;d, who yet remain&amp;#39;d At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen Him whom they heard so late expresly call&amp;#39;d Jesus Messiah Son of God declar&amp;#39;d, And on that high Authority had believ&amp;#39;d, And with him talkt, and with him lodg&amp;#39;d, I mean Andrew and Simon, famous after known With others though in Holy Writ not nam&amp;#39;d, Now missing him thir joy so lately found, So lately found, and so abruptly gone, Began to doubt, and doubted many days, And as the days increas&amp;#39;d, increas&amp;#39;d thir doubt: Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn, And for a time caught up to God, as once Moses was in the Mount, and missing long; And the great Thisbite who on fiery wheels Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come. Therefore as those young Prophets then with care Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico The City of Palms, Ænon, and Salem Old, Machærus and each Town or City wall&amp;#39;d On this side the broad lake Genezaret, Or in Perea, but return&amp;#39;d in vain. Then on the bank of Jordan, by a Creek: Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp&amp;#39;ring play Plain Fishermen, no greater men them call, Close in a Cottage low together got Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath&amp;#39;d. Alas, from what high hope to what relapse Unlook&amp;#39;d for are we fall&amp;#39;n, our eyes beheld Messiah certainly now come, so long Expected of our Fathers; we have heard His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth, Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand, The Kingdom shall to Israel be restor&amp;#39;d: Thus we rejoyc&amp;#39;d, but soon our joy is turn&amp;#39;d Into perplexity and new amaze: For whither is he gone, what accident Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire After appearance, and again prolong Our expectation? God of Israel, Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come; Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow&amp;#39;r unjust They have exalted, and behind them cast All fear of thee, arise and vindicate Thy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke, But let us wait; thus far he hath perform&amp;#39;d, Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal&amp;#39;d him, By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown, In publick, and with him we have convers&amp;#39;d; Let us be glad of this, and all our fears Lay on his Providence; he will not fail Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return. Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume To find whom at the first they found unsought: But to his Mother Mary, when she saw Others return&amp;#39;d from Baptism, not her Son, Nor left at Jordan, tydings of him none; Within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, Motherly cares and fears got head, and rais&amp;#39;d Some troubl&amp;#39;d thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad. O what avails me now that honour high To have conceiv&amp;#39;d of God, or that salute Hale highly favour&amp;#39;d, among women blest; While I to sorrows am no less advanc&amp;#39;t, And fears as eminent, above the lot Of other women, by the birth I bore, In such a season born when scarce a Shed Could be obtain&amp;#39;d to shelter him or me From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth, A Manger his, yet soon enforc&amp;#39;t to flye Thence into Egypt, till the Murd&amp;#39;rous King Were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill&amp;#39;d With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem; From Egypt home return&amp;#39;d, in Nazareth Hath been our dwelling many years, his life Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, Little suspicious to any King; but now Full grown to Man, acknowledg&amp;#39;d, as I hear, By John the Baptist, and in publick shown, Son own&amp;#39;d from Heaven by his Father&amp;#39;s voice; I look&amp;#39;t for some great change; to Honour? no, But trouble, as old Simeon plain fore-told, That to the fall and rising he should be Of many in Israel, and to a sign Spoken against, that through my very Soul A sword shall pierce, this is my favour&amp;#39;d lot, My Exaltation to Afflictions high; Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest; I will not argue that, nor will repine. But where delays he now? some great intent Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, I lost him, but so found, as well I saw He could not lose himself; but went about His Father&amp;#39;s business; what he meant I mus&amp;#39;d, Since understand; much more his absence now Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. But I to wait with patience am inur&amp;#39;d; My heart hath been a store-house long of things And sayings laid up, portending strange events. Thus Mary pondering oft, and oft to mind Recalling what remarkably had pass&amp;#39;d Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts Meekly compos&amp;#39;d awaited the fulfilling: The while her Son tracing the Desert wild, Sole but with holiest Meditations fed, Into himself descended, and at once All his great work to come before him set; How to begin, how to accomplish best His end of being on Earth, and mission high: For Satan with slye preface to return Had left him vacant, and with speed was gon Up to the middle Region of thick Air, Where all his Potentates in Council sate; There without sign of boast, or sign of joy, Sollicitous and blank he thus began. Princes, Heavens antient Sons, Æthereal Thrones, Demonian Spirits now, from the Element Each of his reign allotted, rightlier call&amp;#39;d, Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath, So may we hold our place and these mild seats Without new trouble; such an Enemy Is ris&amp;#39;n to invade us, who no less Threat&amp;#39;ns then our expulsion down to Hell; I, as I undertook, and with the vote Consenting in full frequence was impowr&amp;#39;d, Have found him, view&amp;#39;d him, tasted him, but find Far other labour to be undergon Then when I dealt with Adam first of Men, Though Adam by his Wives allurement fell, However to this Man inferior far, If he be Man by Mothers side at least, With more then humane gifts from Heaven adorn&amp;#39;d, Perfections absolute, Graces divine, And amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds. Therefore I am return&amp;#39;d, lest confidence Of my success with Eve in Paradise Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure Of like succeeding here; I summon all Rather to be in readiness, with hand Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst Thought none my equal, now be over-match&amp;#39;d. So spake the old Serpent doubting, and from all With clamour was assur&amp;#39;d thir utmost aid At his command; when from amidst them rose Belial the dissolutest Spirit that fell, The sensuallest, and after Asmodai The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advis&amp;#39;d. Set women in his eye and in his walk, Among daughters of men the fairest found; Many are in each Region passing fair As the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet, Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues Perswasive, Virgin majesty with mild And sweet allay&amp;#39;d, yet terrible to approach, Skill&amp;#39;d to retire, and in retiring draw Hearts after them tangl&amp;#39;d in Amorous Nets. Such object hath the power to soft&amp;#39;n and tame Severest temper, smooth the rugged&amp;#39;st brow, Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, Draw out with credulous desire, and lead At will the manliest, resolutest brest, As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws. Women, when nothing else, beguil&amp;#39;d the heart Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives. To whom quick answer Satan thus return&amp;#39;d. Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh&amp;#39;st All others by thy self; because of old Thou thy self doat&amp;#39;st on womankind, admiring Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, None are, thou think&amp;#39;st, but taken with such toys. Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew, False titl&amp;#39;d Sons of God, roaming the Earth Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, And coupl&amp;#39;d with them, and begot a race. Have we not seen, or by relation heard, In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk&amp;#39;st, In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side, In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more Too long, then lay&amp;#39;st thy scapes on names ador&amp;#39;d, Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan? But these haunts Delight not all; among the Sons of Men, How many have with a smile made small account Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn&amp;#39;d All her assaults, on worthier things intent? Remember that Pellean Conquerour, A youth, how all the Beauties of the East He slightly view&amp;#39;d, and slightly over-pass&amp;#39;d; How hee sirnam&amp;#39;d of Africa dismiss&amp;#39;d In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. For Solomon he liv&amp;#39;d at ease, and full Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim&amp;#39;d not beyond Higher design then to enjoy his State; Thence to the bait of Women lay expos&amp;#39;d; But he whom we attempt is wiser far Then Solomon, of more exalted mind, Made and set wholly on the accomplishment Of greatest things; what woman will you find, Though of this Age the wonder and the fame, On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye Of fond desire? or should she confident, As sitting Queen ador&amp;#39;d on Beauties Throne, Descend with all her winning charms begirt To enamour, as the Zone of Venus once Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables tell; How would one look from his Majestick brow Seated as on the top of Vertues hill, Discount&amp;#39;nance her despis&amp;#39;d, and put to rout All her array; her female pride deject, Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands In the admiration only of weak minds Led captive; cease to admire, and all her Plumes Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, At every sudden slighting quite abasht: Therefore with manlier objects we must try His constancy, with such as have more shew Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck&amp;#39;d; Or that which only seems to satisfie Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond; And now I know he hungers where no food Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness; The rest commit to me, I shall let pass No advantage, and his strength as oft assay. He ceas&amp;#39;d, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band Of Spirits likest to himself in guile To be at hand, and at his beck appear, If cause were to unfold some active Scene Of various persons each to know his part; Then to the Desert takes with these his flight; Where still from shade to shade the Son of God After forty days fasting had remain&amp;#39;d, Now hungring first, and to himself thus said. Where will this end? four times ten days I have pass&amp;#39;d Wandring this woody maze, and humane food Nor tasted, nor had appetite; that Fast To Vertue I impute not, or count part Of what I suffer here; if Nature need not, Or God support Nature without repast Though needing, what praise is it to endure? But now I feel I hunger, which declares, Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God Can satisfie that need some other way, Though hunger still remain: so it remain Without this bodies wasting, I content me, And from the sting of Famine fear no harm, Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will. It was the hour of night, when thus the Son Commun&amp;#39;d in silent walk, then laid him down Under the hospitable covert nigh Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept, And dream&amp;#39;d, as appetite is wont to dream, Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet; Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood And saw the Ravens with their horny beaks Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn, Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: He saw the Prophet also how he fled Into the Desert, and how there he slept Under a Juniper; then how awakt, He found his Supper on the coals prepar&amp;#39;d, And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, And eat the second time after repose, The strength whereof suffic&amp;#39;d him forty days; Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak&amp;#39;d. Up to a hill anon his steps he rear&amp;#39;d, From whose high top to ken the prospect round, If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd; But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw, Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove, With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud; Thither he bent his way, determin&amp;#39;d there To rest at noon, and entr&amp;#39;d soon the shade High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown That open&amp;#39;d in the midst a woody Scene, Natures own work it seem&amp;#39;d (Nature taught Art) And to a Superstitious eye the haunt Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view&amp;#39;d it round, When suddenly a man before him stood, Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred, And with fair speech these words to him address&amp;#39;d. With granted leave officious I return, But much more wonder that the Son of God In this wild solitude so long should bide Of all things destitute, and well I know, Not without hunger. Others of some note, As story tells, have trod this Wilderness; The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he relief By a providing Angel; all the race Of Israel here had famish&amp;#39;d, had not God Rain&amp;#39;d from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold Native of Thebes wandring here was fed Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. Of thee these forty days none hath regard, Forty and more deserted here indeed. To whom thus Jesus; what conclud&amp;#39;st thou hence? They all had need, I as thou seest have none. How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply&amp;#39;d, Tell me if Food were now before thee set, Would&amp;#39;st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like The giver, answer&amp;#39;d Jesus. Why should that Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend, Hast thou not right to all Created things, Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee Duty and Service, nor to stay till bid, But tender all their power? nor mention I Meats by the Law unclean, or offer&amp;#39;d first To Idols, those young Daniel could refuse; Nor proffer&amp;#39;d by an Enemy, though who Would scruple that, with want opprest? behold Nature asham&amp;#39;d, or better to express, Troubl&amp;#39;d that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey&amp;#39;d From all the Elements her choicest store To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord With honour, only deign to sit and eat. He spake no dream, for as his words had end, Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld In ample space under the broadest shade A Table richly spred, in regal mode, With dishes pill&amp;#39;d, and meats of noblest sort And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game, In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl&amp;#39;d, Gris-amber-steam&amp;#39;d; all Fish from Sea or Shore, Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, And exquisitest name, for which was drain&amp;#39;d Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. Alas how simple, to these Cates compar&amp;#39;d, Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! And at a stately side-board by the wine That fragrant smell diffus&amp;#39;d, in order stood Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant more Under the Trees now trip&amp;#39;d, now solemn stood Nymphs of Diana&amp;#39;s train, and Naiades With fruits and flowers from Amalthea&amp;#39;s horn, And Ladies of th&amp;#39; Hesperides, that seem&amp;#39;d Fairer then feign&amp;#39;d of old, or fabl&amp;#39;d since Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann&amp;#39;d From their soft wings, and Flora&amp;#39;s earliest smells. Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now His invitation earnestly renew&amp;#39;d. What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict Defends the touching of these viands pure, Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, But life preserves, destroys life&amp;#39;s enemy, Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. All these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs, Thy gentle Ministers, who come to pay Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord: What doubt&amp;#39;st thou Son of God? sit down and eat. To whom thus Jesus temperately reply&amp;#39;d: Said&amp;#39;st thou not that to all things I had right? And who withholds my pow&amp;#39;r that right to use? Shall I receive by gift what of my own, When and where likes me best, I can command? I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, Command a Table in this Wilderness, And call swift flights of Angels ministrant Array&amp;#39;d in Glory on my cup to attend: Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, In vain, where no acceptance it can find, And with my hunger what has thou to do? Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn, And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles. To whom thus answer&amp;#39;d Satan malecontent: That I have also power to give thou seest, If of that pow&amp;#39;r I bring thee voluntary What I might have bestow&amp;#39;d on whom I pleas&amp;#39;d, And rather opportunely in this place Chose to impart to thy apparent need, Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see What I can do or offer is suspect; Of these things others quickly will dispose Whose pains have earn&amp;#39;d the far fet spoil. With that Both Table and Provision vanish&amp;#39;d quite With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard; Only the importune Tempter still remain&amp;#39;d, And with these words his temptation pursu&amp;#39;d. By hunger, that each other Creature tames, Thou art not to be harm&amp;#39;d, therefore not mov&amp;#39;d; Thy temperance invincible besides, For no allurement yields to appetite, And all thy heart is set on high designs, High actions; but wherewith to be atchiev&amp;#39;d? Great acts require great means of enterprise, Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, A Carpenter thy Father known, thy self Bred up in poverty and streights at home; Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit: Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire To greatness? whence Authority deriv&amp;#39;st, What Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain, Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude, Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms; What rais&amp;#39;d Antipater the Edomite, And his Son Herod plac&amp;#39;d on Juda&amp;#39;s Throne; (Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap, Not difficult, if thou hearken to me, Riches are mine, Fortune is in my hand; They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want. To whom thus Jesus patiently reply&amp;#39;d; Yet Wealth without these three is impotent, To gain dominion or to keep it gain&amp;#39;d. Witness those antient Empires of the Earth, In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv&amp;#39;d: But men endu&amp;#39;d with these have oft attain&amp;#39;d In lowest poverty to highest deeds; Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad, Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat So many Ages, and shall yet regain That seat, and reign in Israel without end. Among the Heathen, (for throughout the World To me is not unknown what hath been done Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? For I esteem those names of men so poor Who could do mighty things, and could contemn Riches though offer&amp;#39;d from the hand of Kings. And what in me seems wanting, but that I May also in this poverty as soon Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? Extol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools, The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. What if with like aversion I reject Riches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown, Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights To him who wears the Regal Diadem, When on his shoulders each mans burden lies; For therein stands the office of a King, His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise, That for the Publick all this weight he bears. Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; Which every wise and vertuous man attains: And who attains not, ill aspires to rule Cities of men or head-strong Multitudes, Subject himself to Anarchy within, Or lawless passions in him which he serves. But to guide Nations in the way of truth By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead To know, and knowing worship God aright, Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul, Governs the inner man, the nobler part, That other o&amp;#39;re the body only reigns, And oft by force, which to a generous mind So reigning can be no sincere delight. Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought Greater and nobler done, and to lay down Far more magnanimous, then to assume. Riches are needless then, both for themselves, And for thy reason why they should be sought, To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;SO spake the Son of God, and Satan stood A while as mute confounded what to say, What to reply, confuted and convinc&amp;#39;t Of his weak arguing, and fallacious drift; At length collecting all his Serpent wiles, With soothing words renew&amp;#39;d, him thus accosts. I see thou know&amp;#39;st what is of use to know, What best to say canst say, to do canst do; Thy actions to thy words accord, thy words To thy large heart give utterance due, thy heart Conteins of good, wise, just, the perfect shape. Should Kings and Nations from thy mouth consult, Thy Counsel would be as the Oracle Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems On Aaron&amp;#39;s breast: or tongue of Seers old Infallible; or wert thou sought to deeds That might require th&amp;#39; array of war, thy skill Of conduct would be such, that all the world Could not sustain thy Prowess, or subsist In battel, though against thy few in arms. These God-like Vertues wherefore dost thou hide? Affecting private life, or more obscure In savage Wilderness, wherefore deprive All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thy self The fame and glory, glory the reward That sole excites to high attempts the flame Of most erected Spirits, most temper&amp;#39;d pure Ætherial, who all pleasures else despise, All treasures and all gain esteem as dross, And dignities and powers all but the highest? Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe, the Son Of Macedonian Philip had e&amp;#39;re these Won Asia and the Throne of Cyrus held At his dispose, young Scipio had brought down The Carthaginian pride, young Pompey quell&amp;#39;d The Pontic King and in triumph had rode. Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature, Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment. Great Julius, whom now all the world admires The more he grew in years, the more inflam&amp;#39;d With glory, wept that he had liv&amp;#39;d so long Inglorious: but thou yet art not too late. To whom our Saviour calmly thus reply&amp;#39;d. Thou neither dost perswade me to seek wealth For Empires sake, nor Empire to affect For glories sake by all thy argument. For what is glory but the blaze of fame, The peoples praise, if always praise unmixt? And what the people but a herd confus&amp;#39;d, A miscellaneous rabble, who extol Things vulgar, &amp;amp; well weigh&amp;#39;d, scarce worth the praise, They praise and they admire they know not what; And know not whom, but as one leads the other; And what delight to be by such extoll&amp;#39;d, To live upon thir tongues and be thir talk, Of whom to be disprais&amp;#39;d were no small praise? His lot who dares be singularly good. Th&amp;#39; intelligent among them and the wise Are few, and glory scarce of few is rais&amp;#39;d. This is true glory and renown, when God Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks The just man, and divulges him through Heaven To all his Angels, who with true applause Recount his praises; thus he did to Job, When to extend his fame through Heaven &amp;amp; Earth, As thou to thy reproach mayst well remember, He ask&amp;#39;d thee, hast thou seen my servant Job? Famous he was in Heaven, on Earth less known; Where glory is false glory, attributed To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame. They err who count it glorious to subdue By Conquest far and wide, to over-run Large Countries, and in field great Battels win, Great Cities by assault: what do these Worthies, But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave Peaceable Nations, neighbouring, or remote, Made Captive, yet deserving freedom more Then those thir Conquerours, who leave behind Nothing but ruin wheresoe&amp;#39;re they rove, And all the flourishing works of peace destroy, Then swell with pride, and must be titl&amp;#39;d Gods, Great Benefactors of mankind, Deliverers, Worship&amp;#39;t with Temple, Priest and Sacrifice; One is the Son of Jove, of Mars the other, Till Conquerour Death discover them scarce men, Rowling in brutish vices, and deform&amp;#39;d, Violent or shameful death thir due reward. But if there be in glory aught of good, It may by means far different be attain&amp;#39;d Without ambition, war, or violence; By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent, By patience, temperance; I mention still Him whom thy wrongs with Saintly patience born, Made famous in a Land and times obscure; Who names not now with honour patient Job? Poor Socrates (who next more memorable?) By what he taught and suffer&amp;#39;d for so doing, For truths sake suffering death unjust, lives now Equal in fame to proudest Conquerours. Yet if for fame and glory aught be done, Aught suffer&amp;#39;d; if young African for fame His wasted Country freed from Punic rage, The deed becomes unprais&amp;#39;d, the man at least, And loses, though but verbal, his reward. Shall I seek glory then, as vain men seek Oft not deserv&amp;#39;d? I seek not mine, but his Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am. To whom the Tempter murmuring thus reply&amp;#39;d. Think not so slight of glory; therein least Resembling thy great Father: he seeks glory, And for his glory all things made, all things Orders and governs, nor content in Heaven By all his Angels glorifi&amp;#39;d, requires Glory from men, from all men good or bad, Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption; Above all Sacrifice, or hallow&amp;#39;d gift Glory he requires, and glory he receives Promiscuous from all Nations, Jew, or Greek, Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declar&amp;#39;d; From us his foes pronounc&amp;#39;t glory he exacts. To whom our Saviour fervently reply&amp;#39;d. And reason; since his word all things produc&amp;#39;d, Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, But to shew forth his goodness, and impart His good communicable to every soul Freely; of whom what could he less expect Then glory and benediction, that is thanks, The slightest, easiest, readiest recompence From them who could return him nothing else, And not returning that would likeliest render Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? Hard recompence, unsutable return For so much good, so much beneficence. But why should man seek glory? who of his own Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation, ignominy, and shame? Who for so many benefits receiv&amp;#39;d Turn&amp;#39;d recreant to God, ingrate and false, And so of all true good himself despoil&amp;#39;d, Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take That which to God alone of right belongs; Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace, That who advance his glory, not thir own, Them he himself to glory will advance. So spake the Son of God; and here again Satan had not to answer, but stood struck With guilt of his own sin, for he himself Insatiable of glory had lost all, Yet of another Plea bethought him soon. Of glory as thou wilt, said he, so deem, Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass: But to a Kingdom thou art born, ordain&amp;#39;d To sit upon thy Father David&amp;#39;s Throne; By Mothers side thy Father, though thy right Be now in powerful hands, that will not part Easily from possession won with arms; Judæa now and all the promis&amp;#39;d land Reduc&amp;#39;t a Province under Roman yoke, Obeys Tiberius; nor is always rul&amp;#39;d With temperate sway; oft have they violated The Temple, oft the Law with foul affronts, Abominations rather, as did once Antiochus: and think&amp;#39;st thou to regain Thy right by sitting still or thus retiring? So did not Machabeus: he indeed Retir&amp;#39;d unto the Desert, but with arms; And o&amp;#39;re a mighty King so oft prevail&amp;#39;d, That by strong hand his Family obtain&amp;#39;d, Though Priests, the Crown, and David&amp;#39;s Throne usurp&amp;#39;d, With Modin and her Suburbs once content. If Kingdom move thee not, let move thee Zeal, And Duty; Zeal and Duty are not slow; But on Occasions forelock watchful wait. They themselves rather are occasion best, Zeal of thy Fathers house, Duty to free Thy Country from her Heathen servitude; So shalt thou best fullfil, best verifie The Prophets old, who sung thy endless raign, The happier raign the sooner it begins, Raign then; what canst thou better do the while? To whom our Saviour answer thus return&amp;#39;d. All things are best fullfil&amp;#39;d in their due time, And time there is for all things, Truth hath said: If of my raign Prophetic Writ hath told, That it shall never end, so when begin The Father in his purpose hath decreed, He in whose hand all times and seasons roul. What if he hath decreed that I shall first Be try&amp;#39;d in humble state, and things adverse, By tribulations, injuries, insults, Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence, Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting Without distrust or doubt, that he may know What I can suffer, how obey? who best Can suffer, best can do; best reign, who first Well hath obey&amp;#39;d; just tryal e&amp;#39;re I merit My exaltation without change or end. But what concerns it thee when I begin My everlasting Kingdom, why art thou Sollicitous, what moves thy inquisition? Know&amp;#39;st thou not that my rising is thy fall, And my promotion will be thy destruction? To whom the Tempter inly rackt reply&amp;#39;d. Let that come when it comes; all hope is lost Of my reception into grace; what worse? For where no hope is left, is left no fear; If there be worse, the expectation more Of worse torments me then the feeling can. I would be at the worst; worst is my Port, My harbour and my ultimate repose, The end I would attain, my final good. My error was my error and my crime My crime; whatever for it self condemn&amp;#39;d, And will alike be punish&amp;#39;d; whether thou Raign or raign not; though to that gentle brow Willingly I could flye, and hope thy raign, From that placid aspect and meek regard, Rather then aggravate my evil state, Would stand between me and thy Fathers ire, (Whose ire I dread more then the fire of Hell) A shelter and a kind of shading cool Interposition, as a summers cloud. If I then to the worst that can be hast, Why move thy feet so slow to what is best, Happiest both to thy self and all the world, That thou who worthiest art should&amp;#39;st be thir King? Perhaps thou linger&amp;#39;st in deep thoughts detain&amp;#39;d Of the enterprize so hazardous and high; No wonder, for though in thee be united What of perfection can in man be found, Or human nature can receive, consider Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent At home, scarce view&amp;#39;d the Gallilean Towns, And once a year Jerusalem, few days Short sojourn; and what thence could&amp;#39;st thou observe? The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory, Empires, and Monarchs, and thir radiant Courts, Best school of best experience, quickest in sight In all things that to greatest actions lead. The wisest, unexperienc&amp;#39;t, will be ever Timorous and loth, with novice modesty, (As he who seeking Asses found a Kingdom) Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous: But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes The Monarchies of the Earth, thir pomp and state, Sufficient introduction to inform Thee, of thy self so apt, in regal Arts, And regal Mysteries; that thou may&amp;#39;st know How best their opposition to withstand. With that (such power was giv&amp;#39;n him then) he took The Son of God up to a Mountain high. It was a Mountain at whose verdant feet A spatious plain out stretch&amp;#39;t in circuit wide Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flow&amp;#39;d, Th&amp;#39; one winding, the other strait and left between Fair Champain with less rivers interveind, Then meeting joyn&amp;#39;d thir tribute to the Sea: Fertil of corn the glebe, of oyl and wine, With herds the pastures throng&amp;#39;d, with flocks the hills, Huge Cities and high towr&amp;#39;d, that well might seem The seats of mightiest Monarchs, and so large The Prospect was, that here and there was room For barren desert fountainless and dry. To this high mountain top the Tempter brought Our Saviour, and new train of words began. Well have we speeded, and o&amp;#39;re hill and dale, Forest and field, and flood, Temples and Towers Cut shorter many a league; here thou behold&amp;#39;st Assyria and her Empires antient bounds, Araxes and the Caspian lake, thence on As far as Indus East, Euphrates West, And oft beyond; to South the Persian Bay, And inaccessible the Arabian drouth: Here Ninevee, of length within her wall Several days journey, built by Ninus old, Of that first golden Monarchy the seat, And seat of Salmanassar, whose success Israel in long captivity still mourns; There Babylon the wonder of all tongues, As antient, but rebuilt by him who twice Judah and all thy Father David&amp;#39;s house Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis His City there thou seest, and Bactra there; Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates, There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, The drink of none but Kings; of later fame Built by Emathian, or by Parthian hands, The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there Artaxata, Teredon, Tesiphon, Turning with easie eye thou may&amp;#39;st behold. All these the Parthian, now some Ages past, By great Arsaces led, who founded first That Empire, under his dominion holds From the luxurious Kings of Antioch won. And just in time thou com&amp;#39;st to have a view Of his great power; for now the Parthian King In Ctesiphon hath gather&amp;#39;d all his Host Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid He marches now in hast; see, though from far, His thousands, in what martial equipage They issue forth, Steel Bows, and Shafts their arms Of equal dread in flight, or in pursuit; All Horsemen, in which fight they most excel; See how in warlike muster they appear, In Rhombs and wedges, and half moons, and wings. He look&amp;#39;t and saw what numbers numberless The City gates out powr&amp;#39;d, light armed Troops In coats of Mail and military pride; In Mail thir horses clad, yet fleet and strong, Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice Of many Provinces from bound to bound; From Arachosia, from Candaor East, And Margiana to the Hyrcanian cliffs Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales, From Atropatia and the neighbouring plains Of Adiabene, Media, and the South Of Susiana to Balsara&amp;#39;s hav&amp;#39;n. He saw them in thir forms of battell rang&amp;#39;d, How quick they wheel&amp;#39;d, and flying behind them shot Sharp sleet of arrowie showers against the face Of thir pursuers, and overcame by flight; The field all iron cast a gleaming brown, Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor on each horn, Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight; Chariots or Elephants endorst with Towers Of Archers, nor of labouring Pioners A multitude with Spades and Axes arm&amp;#39;d To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, Or where plain was raise hill, or over-lay With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke; Mules after these, Camels and Dromedaries, And Waggons fraught with Utensils of war. Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, When Agrican with all his Northern powers Besieg&amp;#39;d Albracca, as Romances tell; The City of Gallaphrone, from thence to win The fairest of her Sex Angelica His daughter, sought by many Prowest Knights, Both Paynim, and the Peers of Charlemane. Such and so numerous was thir Chivalrie; At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presum&amp;#39;d, And to our Saviour thus his words renew&amp;#39;d. That thou may&amp;#39;st know I seek not to engage Thy Vertue, and not every way secure On no slight grounds thy safety; hear, and mark To what end I have brought thee hither and shewn All this fair sight; thy Kingdom though foretold By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou Endeavour, as thy Father David did, Thou never shalt obtain; prediction still In all things, and all men, supposes means, Without means us&amp;#39;d, what it predicts revokes. But say thou wer&amp;#39;t possess&amp;#39;d of David&amp;#39;s Throne By free consent of all, none opposite, Samaritan or Jew; how could&amp;#39;st thou hope Long to enjoy it quiet and secure, Between two such enclosing enemies Roman and Parthian? therefore one of these Thou must make sure thy own, the Parthian first By my advice, as nearer and of late Found able by invasion to annoy Thy country, and captive lead away her Kings Antigonus, and old Hyrcanus bound, Maugre the Roman: it shall be my task To render thee the Parthian at dispose; Chuse which thou wilt by conquest or by league. By him thou shalt regain, without him not, That which alone can truly reinstall thee In David&amp;#39;s royal seat, his true Successour, Deliverance of thy brethren, those ten Tribes Whose off-spring in his Territory yet serve In Habor, and among the Medes dispers&amp;#39;t, Ten Sons of Jacob, two of Joseph lost Thus long from Israel; serving as of old Thir Fathers in the land of Egypt serv&amp;#39;d, This offer sets before thee to deliver. These if from servitude thou shalt restore To thir inheritance, then, nor till then, Thou on the Throne of David in full glory, From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond Shalt raign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear. To whom our Saviour answer&amp;#39;d thus unmov&amp;#39;d. Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm, And fragile arms, much instrument of war Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, Before mine eyes thou hast set; and in my ear Vented much policy, and projects deep Of enemies, of aids, battels and leagues, Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. Means I must use thou say&amp;#39;st, prediction else Will unpredict and fail me of the Throne: My time I told thee, (and that time for thee Were better farthest off) is not yet come,; When that comes think not thou to find me slack On my part aught endeavouring, or to need Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome Luggage of war there shewn me, argument Of human weakness rather then of strength. My brethren, as thou call&amp;#39;st them; those Ten Tribes I must deliver, if I mean to raign David&amp;#39;s true heir, and his full Scepter sway To just extent over all Israel&amp;#39;s Sons; But whence to thee this zeal, where was it then For Israel, or for David, or his Throne, When thou stood&amp;#39;st up his Tempter to the pride Of numbring Israel, which cost the lives Of threescore and ten thousand Israelites By three days Pestilence? such was thy zeal To Israel then, the same that now to me. As for those captive Tribes, themselves were they Who wrought their own captivity, fell off From God to worship Calves, the Deities Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, And all the Idolatries of Heathen round, Besides thir other worse then heathenish crimes; Nor in the land of their captivity Humbled themselves, or penitent besought The God of their fore-fathers; but so dy&amp;#39;d Impenitent, and left a race behind Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce From Gentils, but by Circumcision vain, And God with Idols in their worship joyn&amp;#39;d. Should I of these the liberty regard, Who freed, as to their antient Patrimony, Unhumbl&amp;#39;d, unrepentant, unreform&amp;#39;d, Headlong would follow; and to thir Gods perhaps Of Bethel and of Dan? no, let them serve Thir enemies, who serve Idols with God. Yet he at length, time to himself best known, Remembring Abraham by some wond&amp;#39;rous call May bring them back repentant and sincere, And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, While to their native land with joy they hast, As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, When to the promis&amp;#39;d land thir Fathers pass&amp;#39;d; To his due time and providence I leave them. So spake Israel&amp;#39;s true King, and to the Fiend Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. So fares it when with truth falshood contends.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;PErplex&amp;#39;d and troubl&amp;#39;d at his bad success The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply, Discover&amp;#39;d in his fraud, thrown from his hope, So oft, and the perswasive Rhetoric That sleek&amp;#39;t his tongue, and won so much on Eve, So little here, nay lost; but Eve was Eve, This far his over-match, who self deceiv&amp;#39;d And rash, before-hand had no better weigh&amp;#39;d The strength he was to cope with, or his own: But as a man who had been matchless held In cunning, over-reach&amp;#39;t where least he thought, To salve his credit, and for very spight Still will be tempting him who foyls him still, And never cease, though to his shame the more; Or as a swarm of flies in vintage time, About the wine-press where sweet moust is powr&amp;#39;d, Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound; Or surging waves against a solid rock, Though all to shivers dash&amp;#39;t, the assault renew, Vain battry, and in froth or bubbles end; So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse Met ever; and to shameful silence brought, Yet gives not o&amp;#39;re though desperate of success, And his vain importunity pursues. He brought our Saviour to the western side Of that high mountain, whence he might behold Another plain, long but in bredth not wide; Wash&amp;#39;d by the Southern Sea, and on the North To equal length back&amp;#39;d with a ridge of hills That screen&amp;#39;d the fruits of the earth and seats of men From cold Septentrion blasts, thence in the midst Divided by a river, of whose banks On each side an Imperial City stood, With Towers and Temples proudly elevate On seven small Hills, with Palaces adorn&amp;#39;d, Porches and Theatres, Baths, Aqueducts, Statues and Trophees, and Triumphal Arcs, Gardens and Groves presented to his eyes, Above the highth of Mountains interpos&amp;#39;d. By what strange Parallax or Optic skill Of vision multiplyed through air, or glass Of Telescope, were curious to enquire: And now the Tempter thus his silence broke. The City which thou seest no other deem Then great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth So far renown&amp;#39;d, and with the spoils enricht Of Nations; there the Capitol thou seest Above the rest lifting his stately head On the Tarpeian rock, her Cittadel Impregnable, and there Mount Palatine The Imperial Palace, compass huge, and high The Structure, skill of noblest Architects, With gilded battlements, conspicuous far, Turrets and Terrases, and glittering Spires. Many a fair Edifice besides, more like Houses of Gods (so well I have dispos&amp;#39;d My Aerie Microscope) thou may&amp;#39;st behold Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs Carv&amp;#39;d work, the hand of fam&amp;#39;d Artificers In Cedar, Marble, Ivory or Gold. Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see What conflux issuing forth, or entring in, Pretors, Proconsuls to thir Provinces Hasting or on return, in robes of State; Lictors and rods the ensigns of thir power, Legions and Cohorts, turmes of horse and wings: Or Embassies from Regions far remote In various habits on the Appian road, Or on the Æmilian, some from farthest South, Syene, and where the shadow both way falls, Meroe Nilotic Isle, and more to West, The Realm of Bocchus to the Black-moor Sea; From the Asian Kings and Parthian among these, From India and the golden Chersoness, And utmost Indian Isle Taprobane, Dusk faces with white silken Turbants wreath&amp;#39;d: From Gallia, Gades, and the Brittish West, Germans and Scythians, and Sarmatians North Beyond Danubius to the Tauric Pool. All Nations now to Rome obedience pay, To Rome&amp;#39;s great Emperour, whose wide domain In ample Territory, wealth and power, Civility of Manners, Arts, and Arms, And long Renown thou justly may&amp;#39;st prefer Before the Parthian; these two Thrones except, The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight, Shar&amp;#39;d among petty Kings too far remov&amp;#39;d; These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all The Kingdoms of the world, and all thir glory. This Emperour hath no Son, and now is old, Old, and lascivious, and from Rome retir&amp;#39;d To Capreæ an Island small but strong On the Campanian shore, with purpose there His horrid lusts in private to enjoy, Committing to a wicked Favourite All publick cares, and yet of him suspicious, Hated of all, and hating; with what ease Indu&amp;#39;d with Regal Vertues as thou art, Appearing, and beginning noble deeds, Might&amp;#39;st thou expel this monster from his Throne Now made a stye, and in his place ascending A victor, people free from servile yoke? And with my help thou may&amp;#39;st; to me the power Is given, and by that right I give it thee. Aim therefore at no less then all the world, Aim at the highest, without the highest attain&amp;#39;d Will be for thee no sitting, or not long On David&amp;#39;s Throne, be propheci&amp;#39;d what will. To whom the Son of God unmov&amp;#39;d reply&amp;#39;d. Nor doth this grandeur and majestic show Of luxury, though call&amp;#39;d magnificence, More then of arms before, allure mine eye, Much less my mind; though thou should&amp;#39;st add to tell Thir sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts On Cittron tables or Atlantic stone; (For I have also heard, perhaps have read) Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne, Chios and Creet, and how they quaff in Gold, Crystal and Myrrhine cups imboss&amp;#39;d with Gems And studs of Pearl, to me should&amp;#39;st tell who thirst And hunger still: then Embassies thou shew&amp;#39;st From Nations far and nigh; what honour that, But tedious wast of time to sit and hear So many hollow complements and lies, Outlandish flatteries? then proceed&amp;#39;st to talk Of the Emperour, how easily subdu&amp;#39;d, How gloriously; I shall, thou say&amp;#39;st, expel A brutish monster: what if I withal Expel a Devil who first made him such? Let his tormenter Conscience find him out, For him I was not sent, nor yet to free That people victor once, now vile and base, Deservedly made vassal, who once just, Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquer&amp;#39;d well, But govern ill the Nations under yoke, Peeling thir Provinces, exhausted all By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown Of triumph that insulting vanity; Then cruel, by thir sports to blood enur&amp;#39;d Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts expos&amp;#39;d, Luxurious by thir wealth, and greedier still, And from the daily Scene effeminate. What wise and valiant man would seek to free These thus degenerate, by themselves enslav&amp;#39;d, Or could of inward slaves make outward free? Know therefore when my season comes to sit On David&amp;#39;s Throne, it shall be like a tree Spreading and over-shadowing all the Earth, Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash All Monarchies besides throughout the world, And of my Kingdom there shall be no end: Means there shall be to this, but what the means, Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell. To whom the Tempter impudent repli&amp;#39;d. I see all offers made by me how slight Thou valu&amp;#39;st, because offer&amp;#39;d, and reject&amp;#39;st: Nothing will please the difficult and nice, Or nothing more then still to contradict: On the other side know also thou, that I On what I offer set as high esteem, Nor what I part with mean to give for naught; All these which in a moment thou behold&amp;#39;st, The Kingdoms of the world to thee I give; For giv&amp;#39;n to me, I give to whom I please, No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else, On this condition, if thou wilt fall down, And worship me as thy superior Lord, Easily done, and hold them all of me; For what can less so great a gift deserve? Whom thus our Saviour answer&amp;#39;d with disdain. I never lik&amp;#39;d thy talk, thy offers less, Now both abhor, since thou hast dar&amp;#39;d to utter The abominable terms, impious condition; But I endure the time, till which expir&amp;#39;d, Thou hast permission on me. It is written The first of all Commandments, Thou shalt worship The Lord thy God, and only him shalt serve; And dar&amp;#39;st thou to the Son of God propound To worship thee accurst, now more accurst For this attempt bolder then that on Eve, And more blasphemous? which expect to rue. The Kingdoms of the world to thee were giv&amp;#39;n, Permitted rather, and by thee usurp&amp;#39;t, Other donation none thou canst produce: If given, by whom but by the King of Kings, God over all supreme? if giv&amp;#39;n to thee, By thee how fairly is the Giver now Repaid? But gratitude in thee is lost Long since. Wert thou so void of fear or shame, As offer them to me the Son of God, To me my own, on such abhorred pact, That I fall down and worship thee as God? Get thee behind me; plain thou now appear&amp;#39;st That Evil one, Satan for ever damn&amp;#39;d. To whom the Fiend with fear abasht reply&amp;#39;d. Be not so sore offended, Son of God; Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men, If I to try whether in higher sort Then these thou bear&amp;#39;st that title, have propos&amp;#39;d What both from Men and Angels I receive, Tetrarchs of fire, air, flood, and on the earth Nations besides from all the quarter&amp;#39;d winds, God of this world invok&amp;#39;t and world beneath; Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold To me so fatal, me it most concerns. The tryal hath indamag&amp;#39;d thee no way, Rather more honour left and more esteem; Me naught advantag&amp;#39;d, missing what I aim&amp;#39;d. Therefore let pass, as they are transitory, The Kingdoms of this world; I shall no more Advise thee, gain them as thou canst, or not. And thou thy self seem&amp;#39;st otherwise inclin&amp;#39;d Then to a worldly Crown, addicted more To contemplation and profound dispute, As by that early action may be judg&amp;#39;d, When slipping from thy Mothers eye thou went&amp;#39;st Alone into the Temple; there was found Among the gravest Rabbies disputant On points and questions fitting Moses Chair, Teaching not taught; the childhood shews the man, As morning shews the day. Be famous then By wisdom; as thy Empire must extend, So let extend thy mind o&amp;#39;re all the world, In knowledge, all things in it comprehend, All knowledge is not couch&amp;#39;t in Moses Law, The Pentateuch or what the Prophets wrote, The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach To admiration, led by Natures light; And with the Gentiles much thou must converse, Ruling them by perswasion as thou mean&amp;#39;st, Without thir learning how wilt thou with them, Or they with thee hold conversation meet? How wilt thou reason with them, how refute Thir Idolisms, Traditions, Paradoxes? Error by his own arms is best evinc&amp;#39;t. Look once more e&amp;#39;re we leave this specular Mount Westward, much nearer by Southwest, behold Where on the Ægean shore a City stands Built nobly, pure the air, and light the soil, Athens the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts And Eloquence, native to famous wits Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, City or Suburban, studious walks and shades; See there the Olive Grove of Academe, Plato&amp;#39;s retirement, where the Attic Bird Trills her thick-warbl&amp;#39;d notes the summer long, There flowrie hill Hymettus with the sound Of Bees industrious murmur oft invites To studious musing; there Ilissus rouls His whispering stream; within the walls then view The schools of antient Sages; his who bred Great Alexander to subdue the world, Lyceum there, and painted Stoa next: There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power Of harmony in tones and numbers hit By voice or hand, and various-measur&amp;#39;d verse, Æolian charms and Dorian Lyric Odes, And his who gave them breath, but higher sung, Blind Melesigenes thence Homer call&amp;#39;d, Whose Poem Phoebus challeng&amp;#39;d for his own. Thence what the lofty grave Tragoedians taught In Chorus or Iambic, teachers best Of moral prudence, with delight receiv&amp;#39;d In brief sententious precepts, while they treat Of fate, and chance, and change in human life; High actions, and high passions best describing: Thence to the famous Orators repair, Those antient, whose resistless eloquence Wielded at will that fierce Democratie, Shook the Arsenal and fulmin&amp;#39;d over Greece, To Macedon, and Artaxerxes Throne; To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear, From Heaven descended to the low-rooft house Of Socrates, see there his Tenement, Whom well inspir&amp;#39;d the Oracle pronounc&amp;#39;d Wisest of men; from whose mouth issu&amp;#39;d forth Mellifluous streams that water&amp;#39;d all the schools Of Academics old and new, with those Sirnam&amp;#39;d Peripatetics, and the Sect Epicurean, and the Stoic severe; These here revolve, or, as thou lik&amp;#39;st, at home, Till time mature thee to a Kingdom&amp;#39;s waight; These rules will render thee a King compleat Within thy self, much more with Empire joyn&amp;#39;d. To whom our Saviour sagely thus repli&amp;#39;d. Think not but that I know these things, or think I know them not; not therefore am I short Of knowing what I aught: he who receives Light from above, from the fountain of light, No other doctrine needs, though granted true; But these are false, or little else but dreams, Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm. The first and wisest of them all profess&amp;#39;d To know this only, that he nothing knew; The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits, A third sort doubted all things, though plain sence; Others in vertue plac&amp;#39;d felicity, But vertue joyn&amp;#39;d with riches and long life, In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease, The Stoic last in Philosophic pride, By him call&amp;#39;d vertue; and his vertuous man, Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer, As fearing God nor man, contemning all Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life, Which when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can, For all his tedious talk is but vain boast, Or subtle shifts conviction to evade. Alas what can they teach, and not mislead; Ignorant of themselves, of God much more, And how the world began, and how man fell Degraded by himself, on grace depending? Much of the Soul they talk, but all awrie, And in themselves seek vertue, and to themselves All glory arrogate, to God give none, Rather accuse him under usual names, Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite Of mortal things. Who therefore seeks in these True wisdom, finds her not, or by delusion Far worse, her false resemblance only meets, An empty cloud. However many books Wise men have said are wearisom; who reads Incessantly, and to his reading brings not A spirit and judgment equal or superior, (And what he brings, what needs he elsewhere seek) Uncertain and unsettl&amp;#39;d still remains, Deep verst in books and shallow in himself, Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys, And trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge; As Children gathering pibles on the shore. Or if I would delight my private hours With Music or with Poem, where so soon As in our native Language can I find That solace? All our Law and Story strew&amp;#39;d With Hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscrib&amp;#39;d, Our Hebrew Songs and Harps in Babylon, That pleas&amp;#39;d so well our Victors ear, declare That rather Greece from us these Arts deriv&amp;#39;d; Ill imitated, while they loudest sing The vices of thir Deities, and thir own In Fable, Hymn, or Song, so personating Thir Gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame. Remove their swelling Epithetes thick laid As varnish on a Harlots cheek, the rest, Thin sown with aught of profit or delight, Will far be found unworthy to compare With Sion&amp;#39;s songs, to all true tasts excelling, Where God is prais&amp;#39;d aright, and Godlike men, The Holiest of Holies, and his Saints; Such are from God inspir&amp;#39;d, not such from thee; Unless where moral vertue is express&amp;#39;t By light of Nature not in all quite lost. Thir Orators thou then extoll&amp;#39;st, as those The top of Eloquence, Statists indeed, And lovers of thir Country, as may seem; But herein to our Prophets far beneath, As men divinely taught, and better teaching The solid rules of Civil Government In thir majestic unaffected stile Then all the Oratory of Greece and Rome. In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt, What makes a Nation happy, and keeps it so, What ruins Kingdoms, and lays Cities flat; These only with our Law best form a King. So spake the Son of God; but Satan now Quite at a loss, for all his darts were spent, Thus to our Saviour with stern brow reply&amp;#39;d. Since neither wealth, nor honour, arms nor arts, Kingdom nor Empire pleases thee, nor aught By me propos&amp;#39;d in life contemplative, Or active, tended on by glory, or fame, What dost thou in this World? the Wilderness For thee is fittest place, I found thee there, And thither will return thee, yet remember What I foretell thee, soon thou shalt have cause To wish thou never hadst rejected thus Nicely or cautiously my offer&amp;#39;d aid, Which would have set thee in short time with ease On David&amp;#39;s Throne; or Throne of all the world, Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season, When Prophesies of thee are best fullfill&amp;#39;d. Now contrary, if I read aught in Heaven, Or Heav&amp;#39;n write aught of Fate, by what the Stars Voluminous, or single characters, In their conjunction met, give me to spell, Sorrows, and labours, opposition, hate, Attends thee, scorns, reproaches, injuries, Violence and stripes, and lastly cruel death, A Kingdom they portend thee, but what Kingdom, Real or Allegoric I discern not, Nor when, eternal sure, as without end, Without beginning; for no date prefixt Directs me in the Starry Rubric set. So saying he took (for still he knew his power Not yet expir&amp;#39;d) and to the Wilderness Brought back the Son of God, and left him there, Feigning to disappear. Darkness now rose, As day-light sunk, and brought in lowring night Her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both, Privation meer of light and absent day. Our Saviour meek and with untroubl&amp;#39;d mind After his aerie jaunt, though hurried sore, Hungry and cold betook him to his rest, Wherever, under some concourse of shades Whose branching arms thick intertwind might shield From dews and damps of night his shelter&amp;#39;d head, But shelter&amp;#39;d slept in vain, for at his head The Tempter watch&amp;#39;d, and soon with ugly dreams Disturb&amp;#39;d his sleep; and either Tropic now Gan thunder, and both ends of Heav&amp;#39;n, the Clouds From many a horrid rift abortive pour&amp;#39;d Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire In ruine reconcil&amp;#39;d: nor slept the winds Within thir stony caves, but rush&amp;#39;d abroad From the four hinges of the world, and fell On the vext Wilderness, whose tallest Pines, Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest Oaks Bow&amp;#39;d their Stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, Or torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded then, O patient Son of God, yet only stoodst Unshaken; nor yet staid the terror there, Infernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, round Environ&amp;#39;d thee, some howl&amp;#39;d, some yell&amp;#39;d, some shriek&amp;#39;d, Some bent at thee thir fiery darts, while thou Sat&amp;#39;st unappall&amp;#39;d in calm and sinless peace. Thus pass&amp;#39;d the night so foul till morning fair Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray; Who with her radiant finger still&amp;#39;d the roar Of thunder, chas&amp;#39;d the clouds, and laid the winds, And grisly Spectres, which the Fiend had rais&amp;#39;d To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. And now the Sun with more effectual beams Had chear&amp;#39;d the face of Earth, and dry&amp;#39;d the wet From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds Who all things now behold more fresh and green, After a night of storm so ruinous, Clear&amp;#39;d up their choicest notes in bush and spray To gratulate the sweet return of morn; Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn Was absent, after all his mischief done, The Prince of darkness, glad would also seem Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came, Yet with no new device, they all were spent, Rather by this his last affront resolv&amp;#39;d, Desperate of better course, to vent his rage, And mad despight to be so oft repell&amp;#39;d. Him walking on a Sunny hill he found, Back&amp;#39;d on the North and West by a thick wood, Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape; And in a careless mood thus to him said. Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God, After a dismal night; I heard the rack As Earth and Skie would mingle; but my self Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven, Or to the Earths dark basis underneath, Are to the main as inconsiderable, And harmless, if not wholsom, as a sneeze To mans less universe, and soon are gone; Yet as being oft times noxious where they light On man, beast, plant, wastful and turbulent, Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, Over whose heads they rore, and seem to point, They oft fore-signifie and threaten ill: This Tempest at this Desert most was bent; Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell&amp;#39;st. Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject The perfet season offer&amp;#39;d with my aid To win thy destin&amp;#39;d seat, but wilt prolong All to the push of Fate, persue thy way Of gaining David&amp;#39;s Throne no man knows when, For both the when and how is no where told, Thou shalt be what thou art ordain&amp;#39;d, no doubt; For Angels have proclaim&amp;#39;d it, but concealing The time and means: each act is rightliest done, Not when it must, but when it may be best. If thou observe not this, be sure to find, What I foretold thee, many a hard assay Of dangers, and adversities and pains, E&amp;#39;re thou of Israel&amp;#39;s Scepter get fast hold; Whereof this ominous night that clos&amp;#39;d thee round, So many terrors, voices, prodigies May warn thee, as a sure fore-going sign. So talk&amp;#39;d he, while the Son of God went on And staid not, but in brief him answer&amp;#39;d thus. Mee worse then wet thou find&amp;#39;st not; other harm Those terrors which thou speak&amp;#39;st of, did me none; I never fear&amp;#39;d they could, though noising loud And threatning nigh; what they can do as signs Betok&amp;#39;ning, or ill boding, I contemn As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; Who knowing I shall raign past thy preventing, Obtrud&amp;#39;st thy offer&amp;#39;d aid, that I accepting At least might seem to hold all power of thee, Ambitious spirit, and wouldst be thought my God, And storm&amp;#39;st refus&amp;#39;d, thinking to terrifie Mee to thy will; desist, thou art discern&amp;#39;d And toil&amp;#39;st in vain, nor me in vain molest. To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage reply&amp;#39;d: Then hear, O Son of David, Virgin-born; For Son of God to me is yet in doubt, Of the Messiah I have heard foretold By all the Prophets; of thy birth at length Announc&amp;#39;t by Gabriel with the first I knew, And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem field, On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. From that time seldom have I ceas&amp;#39;d to eye Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; Till at the Ford of Jordan whither all Flock&amp;#39;d to the Baptist, I among the rest, Though not to be Baptiz&amp;#39;d, by voice from Heav&amp;#39;n Heard thee pronounc&amp;#39;d the Son of God belov&amp;#39;d. Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view And narrower Scrutiny, that I might learn In what degree or meaning thou art call&amp;#39;d The Son of God, which bears no single sence; The Son of God I also am, or was, And if I was, I am; relation stands; All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought In some respect far higher so declar&amp;#39;d. Therefore I watch&amp;#39;d thy footsteps from that hour, And follow&amp;#39;d thee still on to this wast wild; Where by all best conjectures I collect Thou art to be my fatal enemy. Good reason then, if I before-hand seek To understand my Adversary, who And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent, By parl, or composition, truce, or league To win him, or win from him what I can. And opportunity I here have had To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee Proof against all temptation as a rock Of Adamant, and as a Center, firm To the utmost of meer man both wise and good, Not more; for Honours, Riches, Kingdoms, Glory Have been before contemn&amp;#39;d, and may agen: Therefore to know what more thou art then man, Worth naming Son of God by voice from Heav&amp;#39;n, Another method I must now begin. So saying he caught him up, and without wing Of Hippogrif bore through the Air sublime Over the Wilderness and o&amp;#39;re the Plain; Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, The holy City lifted high her Towers, And higher yet the glorious Temple rear&amp;#39;d Her pile, far off appearing like a Mount Of Alabaster, top&amp;#39;t with Golden Spires: There on the highest Pinacle he set The Son of God; and added thus in scorn: There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright Will ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers house Have brought thee, and highest plac&amp;#39;t, highest is best, Now shew thy Progeny; if not to stand, Cast thy self down; safely if Son of God: For it is written, He will give command Concerning thee to his Angels, in thir hands They shall up lift thee, lest at any time Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone. To whom thus Jesus: also it is written, Tempt not the Lord thy God, he said and stood. But Satan smitten with amazement fell As when Earths Son Antæus (to compare Small things with greatest) in Irassa strove With Joves Alcides, and oft foil&amp;#39;d still rose, Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joyn&amp;#39;d, Throttl&amp;#39;d at length in the Air, expir&amp;#39;d and fell; So after many a foil the Tempter proud, Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride Fell whence he stood to see his Victor fall. And as that Theban Monster that propos&amp;#39;d Her riddle, and him, who solv&amp;#39;d it not, devour&amp;#39;d; That once found out and solv&amp;#39;d, for grief and spight Cast her self headlong from th&amp;#39; Ismenian steep, So strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend, And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought Joyless triumphals of his hop&amp;#39;t success, Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God. So Satan fell and strait a fiery Globe Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, Who on their plumy Vans receiv&amp;#39;d him soft From his uneasie station, and upbore As on a floating couch through the blithe Air, Then in a flowry valley set him down On a green bank, and set before him spred A table of Celestial Food, Divine, Ambrosial, Fruits fetcht from the tree of life, And from the fount of life Ambrosial drink, That soon refresh&amp;#39;d him wearied, and repair&amp;#39;d What hunger, if aught hunger had impair&amp;#39;d, Or thirst, and as he fed, Angelic Quires Sung Heavenly Anthems of his victory Over temptation, and the Tempter proud. True Image of the Father whether thron&amp;#39;d In the bosom of bliss, and light of light Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, enshrin&amp;#39;d In fleshly Tabernacle, and human form, Wandring the Wilderness, whatever place, Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing The Son of God, with Godlike force indu&amp;#39;d Against th&amp;#39; Attempter of thy Fathers Throne, And Thief of Paradise; him long of old Thou didst debel, and down from Heav&amp;#39;n cast With all his Army, now thou hast aveng&amp;#39;d Supplanted Adam, and by vanquishing Temptation, hast regain&amp;#39;d lost Paradise, And frustrated the conquest fraudulent: He never more henceforth will dare set foot In Paradise to tempt; his snares are broke: For though that seat of earthly bliss be fail&amp;#39;d, A fairer Paradise is founded now For Adam and his chosen Sons, whom thou A Saviour art come down to re-install. Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be Of Tempter and Temptation without fear. But thou, Infernal Serpent, shalt not long Rule in the Clouds; like an Autumnal Star Or Lightning thou shalt fall from Heav&amp;#39;n trod down Under his feet: for proof, e&amp;#39;re this thou feel&amp;#39;st Thy wound, yet not thy last and deadliest wound By this repulse receiv&amp;#39;d, and hold&amp;#39;st in Hell No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues Thy bold attempt; hereafter learn with awe To dread the Son of God: he all unarm&amp;#39;d Shall chase thee with the terror of his voice From thy Demoniac holds, possession foul, Thee and thy Legions, yelling they shall flye, And beg to hide them in a herd of Swine, Lest he command them down into the deep Bound, and to torment sent before thir time. Hail Son of the most High, heir of both worlds, Queller of Satan, on thy glorious work Now enter, and begin to save mankind. Thus they the Son of God our Saviour meek Sung Victor, and from Heavenly Feast refresht Brought on his way with joy; hee unobserv&amp;#39;d Home to his Mothers house private return&amp;#39;d.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;To Mr. Lawrence Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son, Now that the fields are dank, and ways are mire, Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire Help waste a sullen day; what may be won From the hard season gaining? Time will run On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire The lily and rose, that neither sow&amp;#39;d nor spun. What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice, Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise To hear the lute well touch&amp;#39;d, or artful voice Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air? He who of those delights can judge, and spare To interpose them oft, is not unwise.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs By the known rules of ancient liberty, When straight a barbarous noise environs me Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes and dogs: As when those hinds that were transform&amp;#39;d to frogs Rail&amp;#39;d at Latona&amp;#39;s twin-born progeny Which after held the sun and moon in fee. But this is got by casting pearl to hogs, That bawl for freedom in their senseless mood, And still revolt when truth would set them free. Licence they mean when they cry liberty; For who loves that, must first be wise and good. But from that mark how far they rove we see, For all this waste of wealth and loss of blood.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;To Mr. H. Lawes, On His Airs Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured song First taught our English music how to span Words with just note and accent, not to scan With Midas’ ears, committing short and long, Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng, With praise enough for Envy to look wan; To after-age thou shalt be writ the man That with smooth air couldst humor best our tongue. Thou honor’st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing To honor thee, the priest of Phœbus’ choir, That tun’st their happiest lines in hymn or story. Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher Than his Casella, whom he wooed to sing, Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;On the Lord General Fairfax at the Siege of Colchester Fairfax, whose name in arms through Europe rings Filling each mouth with envy, or with praise, And all her jealous monarchs with amaze And rumours loud, that daunt remotest kings; Thy firm unshak&amp;#39;n virtue ever brings Victory home, though new rebellions raise Their hydra heads, and the false north displays Her brok&amp;#39;n league, to imp their serpent wings: O yet a nobler task awaits thy hand; For what can war but endless war still breed? Till Truth and Right from Violence be freed, And Public Faith clear&amp;#39;d from the shameful brand Of Public Fraud. In vain doth Valour bleed While Avarice and Rapine share the land.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;To the Lord General Cromwell, May 1652,On the proposals of certain ministers at the Committee for Propagation of the Gospel Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud Not of war only, but detractions rude, Guided by faith and matchless fortitude, To peace and truth thy glorious way hast plough&amp;#39;d, And on the neck of crowned Fortune proud Hast rear&amp;#39;d God&amp;#39;s trophies, and his work pursu&amp;#39;d, While Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbru&amp;#39;d, And Dunbar field, resounds thy praises loud, And Worcester&amp;#39;s laureate wreath; yet much remains To conquer still: peace hath her victories No less renown&amp;#39;d than war. New foes arise Threat&amp;#39;ning to bind our souls with secular chains: Help us to save free Conscience from the paw Of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;On the Late Massacre in Piedmont Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughter&amp;#39;d saints, whose bones Lie scatter&amp;#39;d on the Alpine mountains cold, Ev&amp;#39;n them who kept thy truth so pure of old, When all our fathers worshipp&amp;#39;d stocks and stones; Forget not: in thy book record their groans Who were thy sheep and in their ancient fold Slain by the bloody Piemontese that roll&amp;#39;d Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans The vales redoubl&amp;#39;d to the hills, and they To Heav&amp;#39;n. Their martyr&amp;#39;d blood and ashes sow O&amp;#39;er all th&amp;#39; Italian fields where still doth sway The triple tyrant; that from these may grow A hundred-fold, who having learnt thy way Early may fly the Babylonian woe.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;When I consider how my light is spent, Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide, And that one Talent which is death to hide Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent To serve therewith my Maker, and present My true account, lest he returning chide; “Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?” I fondly ask. But patience, to prevent That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need Either man’s work or his own gifts; who best Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed And post o’er Land and Ocean without rest: They also serve who only stand and wait.”&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Cyriack, whose grandsire on the royal bench Of British Themis, with no mean applause, Pronounced, and in his volumes taught, our laws, Which others at their bar so often wrench, Today deep thoughts resolve with me to drench In mirth that after no repenting draws; Let Euclid rest, and Archimedes pause, And what the Swede intend, and what the French. To measure life learn thou betimes, and know Toward solid good what leads the nearest way; For other things mild Heaven a time ordains, And disapproves that care, though wise in show, That with superfluous burden loads the day, And, when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Cyriack, this three years&amp;#39; day these eyes, though clear To outward view of blemish or of spot, Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot; Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear Of sun or moon or star throughout the year, Or man or woman. Yet I argue not Against Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s hand or will, not bate a jot Of heart or hope, but still bear up and steer Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask? The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied In liberty&amp;#39;s defence, my noble task, Of which all Europe talks from side to side. This thought might lead me through the world&amp;#39;s vain mask Content, though blind, had I no better guide.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Methought I saw my late espoused saint Brought to me, like Alcestis, from the grave, Whom Jove&amp;#39;s great son to her glad husband gave, Rescu&amp;#39;d from death by force, though pale and faint. Mine, as whom wash&amp;#39;d from spot of child-bed taint Purification in the old Law did save, And such as yet once more I trust to have Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint, Came vested all in white, pure as her mind; Her face was veil&amp;#39;d, yet to my fancied sight Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shin&amp;#39;d So clear as in no face with more delight. But Oh! as to embrace me she inclin&amp;#39;d, I wak&amp;#39;d, she fled, and day brought back my night.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, Stol&amp;#39;n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year! My hasting days fly on with full career, But my late spring no bud or blossom shew&amp;#39;th. Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth That I to manhood am arriv&amp;#39;d so near; And inward ripeness doth much less appear, That some more timely-happy spirits endu&amp;#39;th. Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, It shall be still in strictest measure ev&amp;#39;n To that same lot, however mean or high, Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heav&amp;#39;n: All is, if I have grace to use it so As ever in my great Task-Master&amp;#39;s eye.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;[&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heav&amp;#39;ns joy, Sphear-born harmonious Sisters, Voice, and Vers, Wed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ Dead things with inbreath&amp;#39;d sense able to pierce, And to our high-rais&amp;#39;d phantasie present, That undisturbèd Song of pure content, Ay sung before the saphire-colour&amp;#39;d throne To him that sits theron With Saintly shout, and solemn Jubily, Where the bright Seraphim in burning row Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow, And the Cherubick host in thousand quires Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires, With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms, Hymns devout and holy Psalms Singing everlastingly; That we on Earth with undiscording voice May rightly answer that melodious noise; As once we did, till disproportion&amp;#39;d sin Jarr&amp;#39;d against natures chime, and with harsh din Broke the fair musick that all creatures made To their great Lord, whose love their motion sway’d In perfect Diapason, whilst they stood In first obedience, and their state of good. O may we soon again renew that Song And keep in tune with Heav&amp;#39;n, till God ere long To his celestial consort us unite, To live with him, and sing in endles morn of light.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hail native language, that by sinews weak Didst move my first endeavouring tongue to speak, And mad&amp;#39;st imperfect words with childish trips, Half unpronounc&amp;#39;d, slide through my infant lips, Driving dumb Silence from the portal door, Where he had mutely sate two years before: Here I salute thee and thy pardon ask, That now I use thee in my latter task: Small loss it is that thence can come unto thee, I know my tongue but little grace can do thee: Thou needst not be ambitious to be first, Believe me I have thither pack&amp;#39;d the worst: And, if it happen as I did forecast, The daintest dishes shall be serv&amp;#39;d up last. I pray thee then deny me not thy aid For this same small neglect that I have made: But haste thee straight to do me once a pleasure, And from thy wardrobe bring thy chiefest treasure; Not those new-fangled toys, and trimming slight Which takes our late fantastics with delight, But cull those richest robes, and gay&amp;#39;st attire Which deepest spirits, and choicest wits desire. I have some naked thoughts that rove about And loudly knock to have their passage out; And weary of their place do only stay Till thou hast deck&amp;#39;d them in thy best array; That so they may without suspect or fears Fly swiftly to this fair assembly&amp;#39;s ears. Yet I had rather, if I were to choose, Thy service in some graver subject use, Such as may make thee search thy coffers round, Before thou clothe my fancy in fit sound: Such where the deep transported mind may soar Above the wheeling poles, and at heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s door Look in, and see each blissful deity How he before the thunderous throne doth lie, Listening to what unshorn Apollo sings To th&amp;#39;touch of golden wires, while Hebe brings Immortal nectar to her kingly sire; Then passing through the spheres of watchful fire, And misty regions of wide air next under, And hills of snow and lofts of piled thunder, May tell at length how green-ey&amp;#39;d Neptune raves, In heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s defiance mustering all his waves; Then sing of secret things that came to pass When beldam Nature in her cradle was; And last of kings and queens and heroes old, Such as the wise Demodocus once told In solemn songs at king Alcinous&amp;#39; feast, While sad Ulysses&amp;#39; soul and all the rest Are held with his melodious harmony In willing chains and sweet captivity.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hence vain deluding Joys, The brood of Folly without father bred, How little you bested, Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys; Dwell in some idle brain, And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess, As thick and numberless As the gay motes that people the sunbeams, Or likest hovering dreams, The fickle pensioners of Morpheus&amp;#39; train. But hail thou goddess, sage and holy, Hail divinest Melancholy, Whose saintly visage is too bright To hit the sense of human sight; And therefore to our weaker view, O&amp;#39;er-laid with black, staid Wisdom&amp;#39;s hue; Black, but such as in esteem, Prince Memnon&amp;#39;s sister might beseem, Or that starr&amp;#39;d Ethiop queen that strove To set her beauty&amp;#39;s praise above The sea nymphs, and their powers offended. Yet thou art higher far descended, Thee bright-hair&amp;#39;d Vesta long of yore, To solitary Saturn bore; His daughter she (in Saturn&amp;#39;s reign, Such mixture was not held a stain) Oft in glimmering bow&amp;#39;rs and glades He met her, and in secret shades Of woody Ida&amp;#39;s inmost grove, While yet there was no fear of Jove. Come pensive nun, devout and pure, Sober, stedfast, and demure, All in a robe of darkest grain, Flowing with majestic train, And sable stole of cypress lawn, Over thy decent shoulders drawn. Come, but keep thy wonted state, With ev&amp;#39;n step, and musing gait, And looks commercing with the skies, Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes: There held in holy passion still, Forget thyself to marble, till With a sad leaden downward cast, Thou fix them on the earth as fast. And join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet, Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet, And hears the Muses in a ring, Aye round about Jove&amp;#39;s altar sing. And add to these retired Leisure, That in trim gardens takes his pleasure; But first, and chiefest, with thee bring Him that yon soars on golden wing, Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne, The cherub Contemplation; And the mute Silence hist along, &amp;#39;Less Philomel will deign a song, In her sweetest, saddest plight, Smoothing the rugged brow of night, While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke, Gently o&amp;#39;er th&amp;#39; accustom&amp;#39;d oak. Sweet bird that shunn&amp;#39;st the noise of folly, Most musical, most melancholy! Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among, I woo to hear thy even-song; And missing thee, I walk unseen On the dry smooth-shaven green, To behold the wand&amp;#39;ring Moon, Riding near her highest noon, Like one that had been led astray Through the heav&amp;#39;ns wide pathless way; And oft, as if her head she bow&amp;#39;d, Stooping through a fleecy cloud. Oft on a plat of rising ground, I hear the far-off curfew sound, Over some wide-water&amp;#39;d shore, Swinging slow with sullen roar; Or if the air will not permit, Some still removed place will fit, Where glowing embers through the room Teach light to counterfeit a gloom, Far from all resort of mirth, Save the cricket on the hearth, Or the bellman&amp;#39;s drowsy charm, To bless the doors from nightly harm. Or let my lamp at midnight hour, Be seen in some high lonely tow&amp;#39;r, Where I may oft out-watch the Bear, With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere The spirit of Plato, to unfold What worlds, or what vast regions hold The immortal mind that hath forsook Her mansion in this fleshly nook: And of those dæmons that are found In fire, air, flood, or under ground, Whose power hath a true consent With planet, or with element. Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy In sceptr&amp;#39;d pall come sweeping by, Presenting Thebes&amp;#39;, or Pelop&amp;#39;s line, Or the tale of Troy divine, Or what (though rare) of later age, Ennobled hath the buskin&amp;#39;d stage. But, O sad Virgin, that thy power Might raise Musæus from his bower, Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing Such notes as, warbled to the string, Drew iron tears down Pluto&amp;#39;s cheek, And made Hell grant what love did seek. Or call up him that left half told The story of Cambuscan bold, Of Camball, and of Algarsife, And who had Canace to wife, That own&amp;#39;d the virtuous ring and glass, And of the wond&amp;#39;rous horse of brass, On which the Tartar king did ride; And if aught else, great bards beside, In sage and solemn tunes have sung, Of tourneys and of trophies hung, Of forests, and enchantments drear, Where more is meant than meets the ear. Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career, Till civil-suited Morn appear, Not trick&amp;#39;d and frounc&amp;#39;d as she was wont, With the Attic boy to hunt, But kerchief&amp;#39;d in a comely cloud, While rocking winds are piping loud, Or usher&amp;#39;d with a shower still, When the gust hath blown his fill, Ending on the rustling leaves, With minute-drops from off the eaves. And when the Sun begins to fling His flaring beams, me, goddess, bring To arched walks of twilight groves, And shadows brown that Sylvan loves, Of pine, or monumental oak, Where the rude axe with heaved stroke, Was never heard the nymphs to daunt, Or fright them from their hallow&amp;#39;d haunt. There in close covert by some brook, Where no profaner eye may look, Hide me from Day&amp;#39;s garish eye, While the bee with honied thigh, That at her flow&amp;#39;ry work doth sing, And the waters murmuring With such consort as they keep, Entice the dewy-feather&amp;#39;d sleep; And let some strange mysterious dream, Wave at his wings, in airy stream Of lively portraiture display&amp;#39;d, Softly on my eye-lids laid. And as I wake, sweet music breathe Above, about, or underneath, Sent by some spirit to mortals good, Or th&amp;#39; unseen Genius of the wood. But let my due feet never fail To walk the studious cloister&amp;#39;s pale, And love the high embowed roof, With antique pillars massy proof, And storied windows richly dight, Casting a dim religious light. There let the pealing organ blow, To the full-voic&amp;#39;d quire below, In service high, and anthems clear, As may with sweetness, through mine ear, Dissolve me into ecstasies, And bring all Heav&amp;#39;n before mine eyes. And may at last my weary age Find out the peaceful hermitage, The hairy gown and mossy cell, Where I may sit and rightly spell Of every star that Heav&amp;#39;n doth shew, And every herb that sips the dew; Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain. These pleasures, Melancholy, give, And I with thee will choose to live.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Hence loathed Melancholy, Of Cerberus, and blackest Midnight born, In Stygian cave forlorn, &amp;#39;Mongst horrid shapes, and shrieks, and sights unholy; Find out some uncouth cell, Where brooding Darkness spreads his jealous wings, And the night-raven sings; There under ebon shades, and low-brow&amp;#39;d rocks, As ragged as thy locks, In dark Cimmerian desert ever dwell. But come thou goddess fair and free, In heav&amp;#39;n yclep&amp;#39;d Euphrosyne, And by men, heart-easing Mirth, Whom lovely Venus at a birth With two sister Graces more To Ivy-crowned Bacchus bore; Or whether (as some sager sing) The frolic wind that breathes the spring, Zephyr, with Aurora playing, As he met her once a-Maying, There on beds of violets blue, And fresh-blown roses wash&amp;#39;d in dew, Fill&amp;#39;d her with thee, a daughter fair, So buxom, blithe, and debonair. Haste thee nymph, and bring with thee Jest and youthful Jollity, Quips and cranks, and wanton wiles, Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles, Such as hang on Hebe&amp;#39;s cheek, And love to live in dimple sleek; Sport that wrinkled Care derides, And Laughter holding both his sides. Come, and trip it as ye go On the light fantastic toe, And in thy right hand lead with thee, The mountain-nymph, sweet Liberty; And if I give thee honour due, Mirth, admit me of thy crew To live with her, and live with thee, In unreproved pleasures free; To hear the lark begin his flight, And singing startle the dull night, From his watch-tower in the skies, Till the dappled dawn doth rise; Then to come in spite of sorrow, And at my window bid good-morrow, Through the sweet-briar, or the vine, Or the twisted eglantine; While the cock with lively din, Scatters the rear of darkness thin, And to the stack, or the barn door, Stoutly struts his dames before; Oft list&amp;#39;ning how the hounds and horn Cheerly rouse the slumb&amp;#39;ring morn, From the side of some hoar hill, Through the high wood echoing shrill. Sometime walking, not unseen, By hedge-row elms, on hillocks green, Right against the eastern gate, Where the great Sun begins his state, Rob&amp;#39;d in flames, and amber light, The clouds in thousand liveries dight. While the ploughman near at hand, Whistles o&amp;#39;er the furrow&amp;#39;d land, And the milkmaid singeth blithe, And the mower whets his scythe, And every shepherd tells his tale Under the hawthorn in the dale. Straight mine eye hath caught new pleasures Whilst the landskip round it measures, Russet lawns, and fallows gray, Where the nibbling flocks do stray; Mountains on whose barren breast The labouring clouds do often rest; Meadows trim with daisies pied, Shallow brooks, and rivers wide. Towers, and battlements it sees Bosom&amp;#39;d high in tufted trees, Where perhaps some beauty lies, The cynosure of neighbouring eyes. Hard by, a cottage chimney smokes, From betwixt two aged oaks, Where Corydon and Thyrsis met, Are at their savoury dinner set Of herbs, and other country messes, Which the neat-handed Phyllis dresses; And then in haste her bow&amp;#39;r she leaves, With Thestylis to bind the sheaves; Or if the earlier season lead To the tann&amp;#39;d haycock in the mead. Sometimes with secure delight The upland hamlets will invite, When the merry bells ring round, And the jocund rebecks sound To many a youth, and many a maid, Dancing in the chequer&amp;#39;d shade; And young and old come forth to play On a sunshine holiday, Till the live-long daylight fail; Then to the spicy nut-brown ale, With stories told of many a feat, How Faery Mab the junkets eat, She was pinch&amp;#39;d and pull&amp;#39;d she said, And he by friar&amp;#39;s lanthorn led, Tells how the drudging goblin sweat, To earn his cream-bowl duly set, When in one night, ere glimpse of morn, His shadowy flail hath thresh&amp;#39;d the corn That ten day-labourers could not end; Then lies him down, the lubber fiend, And stretch&amp;#39;d out all the chimney&amp;#39;s length, Basks at the fire his hairy strength; And crop-full out of doors he flings, Ere the first cock his matin rings. Thus done the tales, to bed they creep, By whispering winds soon lull&amp;#39;d asleep. Tower&amp;#39;d cities please us then, And the busy hum of men, Where throngs of knights and barons bold, In weeds of peace high triumphs hold, With store of ladies, whose bright eyes Rain influence, and judge the prize Of wit, or arms, while both contend To win her grace, whom all commend. There let Hymen oft appear In saffron robe, with taper clear, And pomp, and feast, and revelry, With mask, and antique pageantry; Such sights as youthful poets dream On summer eves by haunted stream. Then to the well-trod stage anon, If Jonson&amp;#39;s learned sock be on, Or sweetest Shakespeare, Fancy&amp;#39;s child, Warble his native wood-notes wild. And ever against eating cares, Lap me in soft Lydian airs, Married to immortal verse, Such as the meeting soul may pierce In notes with many a winding bout Of linked sweetness long drawn out, With wanton heed, and giddy cunning, The melting voice through mazes running, Untwisting all the chains that tie The hidden soul of harmony; That Orpheus&amp;#39; self may heave his head From golden slumber on a bed Of heap&amp;#39;d Elysian flow&amp;#39;rs, and hear Such strains as would have won the ear Of Pluto, to have quite set free His half-regain&amp;#39;d Eurydice. These delights if thou canst give, Mirth, with thee I mean to live.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Yet once more, O ye laurels, and once more Ye myrtles brown, with ivy never sere, I come to pluck your berries harsh and crude, And with forc\&amp;#39;d fingers rude Shatter your leaves before the mellowing year. Bitter constraint and sad occasion dear Compels me to disturb your season due; For Lycidas is dead, dead ere his prime, Young Lycidas, and hath not left his peer. Who would not sing for Lycidas? he knew Himself to sing, and build the lofty rhyme. He must not float upon his wat\&amp;#39;ry bier Unwept, and welter to the parching wind, Without the meed of some melodious tear. Begin then, Sisters of the sacred well That from beneath the seat of Jove doth spring; Begin, and somewhat loudly sweep the string. Hence with denial vain and coy excuse! So may some gentle muse With lucky words favour my destin\&amp;#39;d urn, And as he passes turn And bid fair peace be to my sable shroud! For we were nurs\&amp;#39;d upon the self-same hill, Fed the same flock, by fountain, shade, and rill; Together both, ere the high lawns appear\&amp;#39;d Under the opening eyelids of the morn, We drove afield, and both together heard What time the gray-fly winds her sultry horn, Batt\&amp;#39;ning our flocks with the fresh dews of night, Oft till the star that rose at ev\&amp;#39;ning bright Toward heav\&amp;#39;n\&amp;#39;s descent had slop\&amp;#39;d his westering wheel. Meanwhile the rural ditties were not mute, Temper\&amp;#39;d to th\&amp;#39;oaten flute; Rough Satyrs danc\&amp;#39;d, and Fauns with clov\&amp;#39;n heel, From the glad sound would not be absent long; And old Damætas lov\&amp;#39;d to hear our song. But O the heavy change now thou art gone, Now thou art gone, and never must return! Thee, Shepherd, thee the woods and desert caves, With wild thyme and the gadding vine o\&amp;#39;ergrown, And all their echoes mourn. The willows and the hazel copses green Shall now no more be seen Fanning their joyous leaves to thy soft lays. As killing as the canker to the rose, Or taint-worm to the weanling herds that graze, Or frost to flowers that their gay wardrobe wear When first the white thorn blows: Such, Lycidas, thy loss to shepherd\&amp;#39;s ear. Where were ye, Nymphs, when the remorseless deep Clos\&amp;#39;d o\&amp;#39;er the head of your lov\&amp;#39;d Lycidas? For neither were ye playing on the steep Where your old bards, the famous Druids, lie, Nor on the shaggy top of Mona high, Nor yet where Deva spreads her wizard stream. Ay me! I fondly dream Had ye bin there\&amp;#39;—for what could that have done? What could the Muse herself that Orpheus bore, The Muse herself, for her enchanting son, Whom universal nature did lament, When by the rout that made the hideous roar His gory visage down the stream was sent, Down the swift Hebrus to the Lesbian shore? Alas! what boots it with incessant care To tend the homely, slighted shepherd\&amp;#39;s trade, And strictly meditate the thankless Muse? Were it not better done, as others use, To sport with Amaryllis in the shade, Or with the tangles of Neæra\&amp;#39;s hair? Fame is the spur that the clear spirit doth raise (That last infirmity of noble mind) To scorn delights and live laborious days; But the fair guerdon when we hope to find, And think to burst out into sudden blaze, Comes the blind Fury with th\&amp;#39;abhorred shears, And slits the thin-spun life. &amp;quot;But not the praise,&amp;quot; Phoebus replied, and touch\&amp;#39;d my trembling ears; &amp;quot;Fame is no plant that grows on mortal soil, Nor in the glistering foil Set off to th\&amp;#39;world, nor in broad rumour lies, But lives and spreads aloft by those pure eyes And perfect witness of all-judging Jove; As he pronounces lastly on each deed, Of so much fame in Heav\&amp;#39;n expect thy meed.&amp;quot; O fountain Arethuse, and thou honour\&amp;#39;d flood, Smooth-sliding Mincius, crown\&amp;#39;d with vocal reeds, That strain I heard was of a higher mood. But now my oat proceeds, And listens to the Herald of the Sea, That came in Neptune\&amp;#39;s plea. He ask\&amp;#39;d the waves, and ask\&amp;#39;d the felon winds, &amp;quot;What hard mishap hath doom\&amp;#39;d this gentle swain?&amp;quot; And question\&amp;#39;d every gust of rugged wings That blows from off each beaked promontory. They knew not of his story; And sage Hippotades their answer brings, That not a blast was from his dungeon stray\&amp;#39;d; The air was calm, and on the level brine Sleek Panope with all her sisters play\&amp;#39;d. It was that fatal and perfidious bark, Built in th\&amp;#39;eclipse, and rigg\&amp;#39;d with curses dark, That sunk so low that sacred head of thine. Next Camus, reverend sire, went footing slow, His mantle hairy, and his bonnet sedge, Inwrought with figures dim, and on the edge Like to that sanguine flower inscrib\&amp;#39;d with woe. &amp;quot;Ah! who hath reft,&amp;quot; quoth he, &amp;quot;my dearest pledge?&amp;quot; Last came, and last did go, The Pilot of the Galilean lake; Two massy keys he bore of metals twain (The golden opes, the iron shuts amain). He shook his mitred locks, and stern bespake: &amp;quot;How well could I have spar\&amp;#39;d for thee, young swain, Enow of such as for their bellies\&amp;#39; sake Creep and intrude, and climb into the fold? Of other care they little reck\&amp;#39;ning make Than how to scramble at the shearers\&amp;#39; feast And shove away the worthy bidden guest. Blind mouths! that scarce themselves know how to hold A sheep-hook, or have learn\&amp;#39;d aught else the least That to the faithful herdman\&amp;#39;s art belongs! What recks it them? What need they? They are sped; And when they list their lean and flashy songs Grate on their scrannel pipes of wretched straw, The hungry sheep look up, and are not fed, But, swoll\&amp;#39;n with wind and the rank mist they draw, Rot inwardly, and foul contagion spread; Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw Daily devours apace, and nothing said, But that two-handed engine at the door Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more&amp;quot;. Return, Alpheus: the dread voice is past That shrunk thy streams; return, Sicilian Muse, And call the vales and bid them hither cast Their bells and flow\&amp;#39;rets of a thousand hues. Ye valleys low, where the mild whispers use Of shades and wanton winds, and gushing brooks, On whose fresh lap the swart star sparely looks, Throw hither all your quaint enamel\&amp;#39;d eyes, That on the green turf suck the honied showers And purple all the ground with vernal flowers. Bring the rathe primrose that forsaken dies, The tufted crow-toe, and pale jessamine, The white pink, and the pansy freak\&amp;#39;d with jet, The glowing violet, The musk-rose, and the well attir\&amp;#39;d woodbine, With cowslips wan that hang the pensive head, And every flower that sad embroidery wears; Bid amaranthus all his beauty shed, And daffadillies fill their cups with tears, To strew the laureate hearse where Lycid lies. For so to interpose a little ease, Let our frail thoughts dally with false surmise. Ay me! Whilst thee the shores and sounding seas Wash far away, where\&amp;#39;er thy bones are hurl\&amp;#39;d; Whether beyond the stormy Hebrides, Where thou perhaps under the whelming tide Visit\&amp;#39;st the bottom of the monstrous world, Or whether thou, to our moist vows denied, Sleep\&amp;#39;st by the fable of Bellerus old, Where the great vision of the guarded mount Looks toward Namancos and Bayona\&amp;#39;s hold: Look homeward Angel now, and melt with ruth; And, O ye dolphins, waft the hapless youth. Weep no more, woeful shepherds, weep no more, For Lycidas, your sorrow, is not dead, Sunk though he be beneath the wat\&amp;#39;ry floor; So sinks the day-star in the ocean bed, And yet anon repairs his drooping head, And tricks his beams, and with new spangled ore Flames in the forehead of the morning sky: So Lycidas sunk low, but mounted high Through the dear might of him that walk\&amp;#39;d the waves; Where, other groves and other streams along, With nectar pure his oozy locks he laves, And hears the unexpressive nuptial song, In the blest kingdoms meek of joy and love. There entertain him all the Saints above, In solemn troops, and sweet societies, That sing, and singing in their glory move, And wipe the tears for ever from his eyes. Now, Lycidas, the shepherds weep no more: Henceforth thou art the Genius of the shore, In thy large recompense, and shalt be good To all that wander in that perilous flood. Thus sang the uncouth swain to th\&amp;#39;oaks and rills, While the still morn went out with sandals gray; He touch\&amp;#39;d the tender stops of various quills, With eager thought warbling his Doric lay; And now the sun had stretch\&amp;#39;d out all the hills, And now was dropp\&amp;#39;d into the western bay; At last he rose, and twitch\&amp;#39;d his mantle blue: To-morrow to fresh woods, and pastures new.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;What needs my Shakespeare for his honoured bones,The labor of an age in pilèd stones,Or that his hallowed relics should be hid Under a star-ypointing pyramid? Dear son of Memory, great heir of fame, What need’st thou such weak witness of thy name?Thou in our wonder and astonishment Hast built thyself a live-long monument. For whilst to th’ shame of slow-endeavouring art, Thy easy numbers flow, and that each heart Hath from the leaves of thy unvalued book Those Delphic lines with deep impression took, Then thou, our fancy of itself bereaving, Dost make us marble with too much conceiving; And so sepúlchred in such pomp dost lie,That kings for such a tomb would wish to die.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;This is the month, and this the happy morn, Wherein the Son of Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s eternal King, Of wedded Maid, and Virgin Mother born, Our great redemption from above did bring; For so the holy sages once did sing, That he our deadly forfeit should release, And with his Father work us a perpetual peace. That glorious Form, that Light unsufferable, And that far-beaming blaze of Majesty, Wherewith he wont at Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s high council-table, To sit the midst of Trinal Unity, He laid aside, and here with us to be, Forsook the courts of everlasting day, And chose with us a darksome house of mortal clay. Say Heav&amp;#39;nly Muse, shall not thy sacred vein Afford a present to the Infant God? Hast thou no verse, no hymn, or solemn strain, To welcome him to this his new abode, Now while the heav&amp;#39;n, by the Sun&amp;#39;s team untrod, Hath took no print of the approaching light, And all the spangled host keep watch in squadrons bright? See how from far upon the eastern road The star-led wizards haste with odours sweet: O run, prevent them with thy humble ode, And lay it lowly at his blessed feet; Have thou the honour first thy Lord to greet, And join thy voice unto the angel quire, From out his secret altar touch&amp;#39;d with hallow&amp;#39;d fire. It was the winter wild, While the Heav&amp;#39;n-born child, All meanly wrapt in the rude manger lies; Nature in awe to him Had doff&amp;#39;d her gaudy trim, With her great Master so to sympathize: It was no season then for her To wanton with the Sun, her lusty paramour. Only with speeches fair She woos the gentle air To hide her guilty front with innocent snow, And on her naked shame, Pollute with sinful blame, The saintly veil of maiden white to throw, Confounded, that her Maker&amp;#39;s eyes Should look so near upon her foul deformities. But he, her fears to cease, Sent down the meek-ey&amp;#39;d Peace: She, crown&amp;#39;d with olive green, came softly sliding Down through the turning sphere, His ready harbinger, With turtle wing the amorous clouds dividing; And waving wide her myrtle wand, She strikes a universal peace through sea and land. No war or battle&amp;#39;s sound Was heard the world around; The idle spear and shield were high uphung; The hooked chariot stood Unstain&amp;#39;d with hostile blood; The trumpet spake not to the armed throng; And kings sate still with awful eye, As if they surely knew their sovran Lord was by. But peaceful was the night Wherein the Prince of Light His reign of peace upon the earth began: The winds with wonder whist, Smoothly the waters kist, Whispering new joys to the mild Ocean, Who now hath quite forgot to rave, While birds of calm sit brooding on the charmed wave. The Stars with deep amaze Stand fix&amp;#39;d in steadfast gaze, Bending one way their precious influence; And will not take their flight, For all the morning light, Or Lucifer that often warn&amp;#39;d them thence, But in their glimmering orbs did glow, Until their Lord himself bespake, and bid them go. And though the shady gloom Had given day her room, The Sun himself withheld his wonted speed, And hid his head for shame, As his inferior flame The new-enlighten&amp;#39;d world no more should need: He saw a greater Sun appear Than his bright throne or burning axle-tree could bear. The shepherds on the lawn, Or ere the point of dawn, Sate simply chatting in a rustic row; Full little thought they than That the mighty Pan Was kindly come to live with them below: Perhaps their loves, or else their sheep, Was all that did their silly thoughts so busy keep; When such music sweet Their hearts and ears did greet, As never was by mortal finger strook, Divinely warbled voice Answering the stringed noise, As all their souls in blissful rapture took: The air such pleasure loth to lose, With thousand echoes still prolongs each heav&amp;#39;nly close. Nature, that heard such sound Beneath the hollow round Of Cynthia&amp;#39;s seat, the Airy region thrilling, Now was almost won To think her part was done, And that her reign had here its last fulfilling: She knew such harmony alone Could hold all heav&amp;#39;n and earth in happier union. At last surrounds their sight A globe of circular light, That with long beams the shame-fac&amp;#39;d Night array&amp;#39;d; The helmed Cherubim And sworded Seraphim Are seen in glittering ranks with wings display&amp;#39;d, Harping in loud and solemn quire, With unexpressive notes to Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s new-born Heir. Such music (as &amp;#39;tis said) Before was never made, But when of old the sons of morning sung, While the Creator great His constellations set, And the well-balanc&amp;#39;d world on hinges hung, And cast the dark foundations deep, And bid the welt&amp;#39;ring waves their oozy channel keep. Ring out ye crystal spheres! Once bless our human ears (If ye have power to touch our senses so) And let your silver chime Move in melodious time, And let the bass of Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s deep organ blow; And with your ninefold harmony Make up full consort to th&amp;#39;angelic symphony. For if such holy song Enwrap our fancy long, Time will run back and fetch the age of gold, And speckl&amp;#39;d Vanity Will sicken soon and die, And leprous Sin will melt from earthly mould; And Hell itself will pass away, And leave her dolorous mansions to the peering Day. Yea, Truth and Justice then Will down return to men, Orb&amp;#39;d in a rainbow; and, like glories wearing, Mercy will sit between, Thron&amp;#39;d in celestial sheen, With radiant feet the tissu&amp;#39;d clouds down steering; And Heav&amp;#39;n, as at some festival, Will open wide the gates of her high palace hall. But wisest Fate says no: This must not yet be so; The Babe lies yet in smiling infancy, That on the bitter cross Must redeem our loss, So both himself and us to glorify: Yet first to those ychain&amp;#39;d in sleep, The wakeful trump of doom must thunder through the deep, With such a horrid clang As on Mount Sinai rang While the red fire and smould&amp;#39;ring clouds outbrake: The aged Earth, aghast With terror of that blast, Shall from the surface to the centre shake, When at the world&amp;#39;s last session, The dreadful Judge in middle air shall spread his throne. And then at last our bliss Full and perfect is, But now begins; for from this happy day Th&amp;#39;old Dragon under ground, In straiter limits bound, Not half so far casts his usurped sway, And, wrath to see his kingdom fail, Swinges the scaly horror of his folded tail. The Oracles are dumb; No voice or hideous hum Runs through the arched roof in words deceiving. Apollo from his shrine Can no more divine, With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving. No nightly trance or breathed spell Inspires the pale-ey&amp;#39;d priest from the prophetic cell. The lonely mountains o&amp;#39;er, And the resounding shore, A voice of weeping heard and loud lament; From haunted spring, and dale Edg&amp;#39;d with poplar pale, The parting Genius is with sighing sent; With flow&amp;#39;r-inwoven tresses torn The Nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn. In consecrated earth, And on the holy hearth, The Lars and Lemures moan with midnight plaint; In urns and altars round, A drear and dying sound Affrights the flamens at their service quaint; And the chill marble seems to sweat, While each peculiar power forgoes his wonted seat. Peor and Ba{:a}lim Forsake their temples dim, With that twice-batter&amp;#39;d god of Palestine; And mooned Ashtaroth, Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s queen and mother both, Now sits not girt with tapers&amp;#39; holy shine; The Libyc Hammon shrinks his horn; In vain the Tyrian maids their wounded Thammuz mourn. And sullen Moloch, fled, Hath left in shadows dread His burning idol all of blackest hue: In vain with cymbals&amp;#39; ring They call the grisly king, In dismal dance about the furnace blue. The brutish gods of Nile as fast, Isis and Orus, and the dog Anubis, haste. Nor is Osiris seen In Memphian grove or green, Trampling the unshower&amp;#39;d grass with lowings loud; Nor can he be at rest Within his sacred chest, Naught but profoundest Hell can be his shroud: In vain with timbrel&amp;#39;d anthems dark The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipp&amp;#39;d ark. He feels from Juda&amp;#39;s land The dreaded Infant&amp;#39;s hand, The rays of Bethlehem blind his dusky eyn; Nor all the gods beside Longer dare abide, Not Typhon huge ending in snaky twine: Our Babe, to show his Godhead true, Can in his swaddling bands control the damned crew. So when the Sun in bed, Curtain&amp;#39;d with cloudy red, Pillows his chin upon an orient wave, The flocking shadows pale Troop to th&amp;#39;infernal jail, Each fetter&amp;#39;d ghost slips to his several grave, And the yellow-skirted fays Fly after the night-steeds, leaving their moon-lov&amp;#39;d maze. But see, the Virgin blest Hath laid her Babe to rest: Time is our tedious song should here have ending. Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s youngest-teemed star, Hath fix&amp;#39;d her polish&amp;#39;d car, Her sleeping Lord with handmaid lamp attending; And all about the courtly stable, Bright-harness&amp;#39;d Angels sit in order serviceable.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;OF Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit Of that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast Brought Death into the World, and all our woe, With loss of Eden, till one greater Man Restore us, and regain the blissful Seat, Sing Heav&amp;#39;nly Muse, that on the secret top Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire That Shepherd, who first taught the chosen Seed, In the Beginning how the Heav&amp;#39;ns and Earth Rose out of Chaos: or if Sion Hill Delight thee more, and Siloa&amp;#39;s brook that flow&amp;#39;d Fast by the Oracle of God; I thence Invoke thy aid to my adventrous Song, That with no middle flight intends to soar Above th&amp;#39; Aonian Mount, while it pursues Things unattempted yet in Prose or Rhime. And chiefly Thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer Before all Temples th&amp;#39; upright heart and pure, Instruct me, for Thou know&amp;#39;st; Thou from the first Wast present, and with mighty wings outspread Dove-like satst brooding on the vast Abyss And mad&amp;#39;st it pregnant: What in me is dark Illumin, what is low raise and support; That to the highth of this great Argument I may assert Eternal Providence, And justifie the wayes of God to men. Say first, for Heav&amp;#39;n hides nothing from thy view Nor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause Mov&amp;#39;d our Grand Parents in that happy State, Favour&amp;#39;d of Heav&amp;#39;n so highly, to fall off From thir Creator, and transgress his Will For one restraint, Lords of the World besides? Who first seduc&amp;#39;d them to that foul revolt? Th&amp;#39; infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile Stird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv&amp;#39;d The Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride Had cast him out from Heav&amp;#39;n, with all his Host Of Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring To set himself in Glory above his Peers, He trusted to have equal&amp;#39;d the most High, If he oppos&amp;#39;d; and with ambitious aim Against the Throne and Monarchy of God Rais&amp;#39;d impious War in Heav&amp;#39;n and Battel proud With vain attempt. Him the Almighty Power Hurld headlong flaming from th&amp;#39; Ethereal Skie With hideous ruine and combustion down To bottomless perdition, there to dwell In Adamantine Chains and penal Fire, Who durst defie th&amp;#39; Omnipotent to Arms. Nine times the Space that measures Day and Night To mortal men, he with his horrid crew Lay vanquisht, rowling in the fiery Gulfe Confounded though immortal: But his doom Reserv&amp;#39;d him to more wrath; for now the thought Both of lost happiness and lasting pain Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes That witness&amp;#39;d huge affliction and dismay Mixt with obdurate pride and stedfast hate: At once as far as Angels kenn he views The dismal Situation waste and wilde, A Dungeon horrible, on all sides round As one great Furnace flam&amp;#39;d, yet from those flames No light, but rather darkness visible Serv&amp;#39;d onely to discover sights of woe, Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace And rest can never dwell, hope never comes That comes to all; but torture without end Still urges, and a fiery Deluge, fed With ever-burning Sulphur unconsum&amp;#39;d: Such place Eternal Justice had prepar&amp;#39;d For those rebellious, here thir prison ordained In utter darkness, and thir portion set As far remov&amp;#39;d from God and light of Heav&amp;#39;n As from the Center thrice to th&amp;#39; utmost Pole. O how unlike the place from whence they fell! There the companions of his fall, o&amp;#39;rewhelm&amp;#39;d With Floods and Whirlwinds of tempestuous fire, He soon discerns, and weltring by his side One next himself in power, and next in crime, Long after known in Palestine, and nam&amp;#39;d Beelzebub. To whom th&amp;#39; Arch-Enemy, And thence in Heav&amp;#39;n call&amp;#39;d Satan, with bold words Breaking the horrid silence thus began. If thou beest he; But O how fall&amp;#39;n! how chang&amp;#39;d From him, who in the happy Realms of Light Cloth&amp;#39;d with transcendent brightness didst out-shine Myriads though bright: If he whom mutual league, United thoughts and counsels, equal hope And hazard in the Glorious Enterprize, Joynd with me once, now misery hath joynd In equal ruin: into what Pit thou seest From what highth fall&amp;#39;n, so much the stronger prov&amp;#39;d He with his Thunder: and till then who knew The force of those dire Arms? yet not for those, Nor what the Potent Victor in his rage Can else inflict, do I repent or change, Though chang&amp;#39;d in outward lustre; that fixt mind And high disdain, from sence of injur&amp;#39;d merit, That with the mightiest rais&amp;#39;d me to contend, And to the fierce contention brought along Innumerable force of Spirits arm&amp;#39;d That durst dislike his reign, and me preferring, His utmost power with adverse power oppos&amp;#39;d In dubious Battel on the Plains of Heav&amp;#39;n, And shook his throne. What though the field be lost? All is not lost; the unconquerable Will, And study of revenge, immortal hate, And courage never to submit or yield: And what is else not to be overcome? That Glory never shall his wrath or might Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace With suppliant knee, and deifie his power, Who from the terrour of this Arm so late Doubted his Empire, that were low indeed, That were an ignominy and shame beneath This downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods And this Empyreal substance cannot fail, Since through experience of this great event In Arms not worse, in foresight much advanc&amp;#39;t, We may with more successful hope resolve To wage by force or guile eternal Warr Irreconcileable, to our grand Foe, Who now triumphs, and in th&amp;#39; excess of joy Sole reigning holds the Tyranny of Heav&amp;#39;n. So spake th&amp;#39; Apostate Angel, though in pain, Vaunting aloud, but rackt with deep despare: And him thus answer&amp;#39;d soon his bold Compeer. O Prince, O Chief of many Throned Powers, That led th&amp;#39; imbattelld Seraphim to Warr Under thy conduct, and in dreadful deeds Fearless, endanger&amp;#39;d Heav&amp;#39;ns perpetual King; And put to proof his high Supremacy, Whether upheld by strength, or Chance, or Fate, Too well I see and rue the dire event, That with sad overthrow and foul defeat Hath lost us Heav&amp;#39;n, and all this mighty Host In horrible destruction laid thus low, As far as Gods and Heav&amp;#39;nly Essences Can perish: for the mind and spirit remains Invincible, and vigour soon returns, Though all our Glory extinct and happy state Here swallow&amp;#39;d up in endless misery. But what if he our Conquerour, (whom I now Of force believe Almighty, since no less Then such could hav orepow&amp;#39;rd such force as ours) Have left us this our spirit and strength intire Strongly to suffer and support our pains, That we may so suffice his vengeful ire, Or do him mightier service as his thralls By right of Warr, what e&amp;#39;re his business be Here in the heart of Hell to work in Fire, Or do his Errands in the gloomy Deep; What can it then avail though yet we feel Strength undiminisht, or eternal being To undergo eternal punishment? Whereto with speedy words th&amp;#39; Arch-fiend reply&amp;#39;d. Fall&amp;#39;n Cherube, to be weak is miserable Doing or Suffering: but of this be sure, To do ought good never will be our task, But ever to do ill our sole delight, As being the contrary to his high will Whom we resist. If then his Providence Out of our evil seek to bring forth good, Our labour must be to pervert that end, And out of good still to find means of evil; Which oft times may succeed, so as perhaps Shall grieve him, if I fail not, and disturb His inmost counsels from thir destind aim. But see the angry Victor hath recall&amp;#39;d His Ministers of vengeance and pursuit Back to the Gates of Heav&amp;#39;n: the Sulphurous Hail Shot after us in storm, oreblown hath laid The fiery Surge, that from the Precipice Of Heav&amp;#39;n receiv&amp;#39;d us falling, and the Thunder, Wing&amp;#39;d with red Lightning and impetuous rage, Perhaps hath spent his shafts, and ceases now To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep. Let us not slip th&amp;#39; occasion, whether scorn, Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe. Seest thou yon dreary Plain, forlorn and wilde, The seat of desolation, voyd of light, Save what the glimmering of these livid flames Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend From off the tossing of these fiery waves, There rest, if any rest can harbour there, And reassembling our afflicted Powers, Consult how we may henceforth most offend Our Enemy, our own loss how repair, How overcome this dire Calamity, What reinforcement we may gain from Hope, If not what resolution from despare. Thus Satan to his neerest Mate With Head up-lift above the wave, and Eyes That sparkling blaz&amp;#39;d, his other Parts besides Prone on the Flood, extended long and large Lay floating many a rood, in bulk as huge As whom the Fables name of monstrous size, Titanian, or Earth-born, that warr&amp;#39;d on Jove, Briareos or Typhon, whom the Den By ancient Tarsus held, or that Sea-beast Leviathan, which God of all his works Created hugest that swim th&amp;#39; Ocean stream: Him haply slumbring on the Norway foam The Pilot of some small night-founder&amp;#39;d Skiff, Deeming some Island, oft, as Sea-men tell, With fixed Anchor in his skaly rind Moors by his side under the Lee, while Night Invests the Sea, and wished Morn delayes: So stretcht out huge in length the Arch-fiend lay Chain&amp;#39;d on the burning Lake, nor ever thence Had ris&amp;#39;n or heav&amp;#39;d his head, but that the will And high permission of all-ruling Heaven Left him at large to his own dark designs, That with reiterated crimes he might Heap on himself damnation, while he sought Evil to others, and enrag&amp;#39;d might see How all his malice serv&amp;#39;d but to bring forth Infinite goodness, grace and mercy shewn On Man by him seduc&amp;#39;t, but on himself Treble confusion, wrath and vengeance pour&amp;#39;d. Forthwith upright he rears from off the Pool His mighty Stature; on each hand the flames Drivn backward slope thir pointing spires, and rowld In billows, leave i&amp;#39;th&amp;#39;midst a horrid Vale. Then with expanded wings he stears his flight Aloft, incumbent on the dusky Air That felt unusual weight, till on dry Land He lights, as if it were Land that ever burn&amp;#39;d With solid, as the Lake with liquid fire; And such appear&amp;#39;d in hue, as when the force Of subterranean wind transports a Hill Torn from Pelorus, or the shatter&amp;#39;d side Of thundring Aetna, whose combustible And fewel&amp;#39;d entrals thence conceiving Fire, Sublim&amp;#39;d with Mineral fury, aid the Winds, And leave a singed bottom all involv&amp;#39;d With stench and smoak: Such resting found the sole Of unblest feet. Him followed his next Mate, Both glorying to have scap&amp;#39;t the Stygian flood As Gods, and by thir own recover&amp;#39;d strength, Not by the sufferance of supernal Power. Is this the Region, this the Soil, the Clime, Said then the lost Arch-Angel, this the seat That we must change for Heav&amp;#39;n, this mournful gloom For that celestial light? Be it so, since he Who now is Sovran can dispose and bid What shall be right: fardest from him his best Whom reason hath equald, force hath made supream Above his equals. Farewel happy Fields Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrours, hail Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell Receive thy new Possessor: One who brings A mind not to be chang&amp;#39;d by Place or Time. The mind is its own place, and in it self Can make a Heav&amp;#39;n of Hell, a Hell of Heav&amp;#39;n. What matter where, if I be still the same, And what I should be, all but less then he Whom Thunder hath made greater? Here at least We shall be free; th&amp;#39; Almighty hath not built Here for his envy, will not drive us hence: Here we may reign secure, and in my choyce To reign is worth ambition though in Hell: Better to reign in Hell, then serve in Heav&amp;#39;n. But wherefore let we then our faithful friends, Th&amp;#39; associates and copartners of our loss Lye thus astonisht on th&amp;#39; oblivious Pool, And call them not to share with us their part In this unhappy Mansion, or once more With rallied Arms to try what may be yet Regaind in Heav&amp;#39;n, or what more lost in Hell? So Satan spake, and him Beelzebub Thus answer&amp;#39;d. Leader of those Armies bright, Which but th&amp;#39; Omnipotent none could have foyld, If once they hear that voyce, thir liveliest pledge Of hope in fears and dangers, heard so oft In worst extreams, and on the perilous edge Of battel when it rag&amp;#39;d, in all assaults Thir surest signal, they will soon resume New courage and revive, though now they lye Groveling and prostrate on yon Lake of Fire, As we erewhile, astounded and amaz&amp;#39;d, No wonder, fall&amp;#39;n such a pernicious highth. He scarce had ceas&amp;#39;t when the superiour Fiend Was moving toward the shoar; his ponderous shield Ethereal temper, massy, large and round, Behind him cast; the broad circumference Hung on his shoulders like the Moon, whose Orb Through Optic Glass the Tuscan Artist views At Ev&amp;#39;ning from the top of Fesole, Or in Valdarno, to descry new Lands, Rivers or Mountains in her spotty Globe. His Spear, to equal which the tallest Pine Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the Mast Of some great Ammiral, were but a wand, He walkt with to support uneasie steps Over the burning Marle, not like those steps On Heavens Azure, and the torrid Clime Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with Fire; Nathless he so endur&amp;#39;d, till on the Beach Of that inflamed Sea, he stood and call&amp;#39;d His Legions, Angel Forms, who lay intrans&amp;#39;t Thick as Autumnal Leaves that strow the Brooks In Vallombrosa, where th&amp;#39; Etrurian shades High overarch&amp;#39;t imbowr; or scatterd sedge Afloat, when with fierce Winds Orion arm&amp;#39;d Hath vext the Red-Sea Coast, whose waves orethrew Busirus and his Memphian Chivalry, While with perfidious hatred they pursu&amp;#39;d The Sojourners of Goshen, who beheld From the safe shore thir floating Carkases And broken Chariot Wheels, so thick bestrown Abject and lost lay these, covering the Flood, Under amazement of thir hideous change. He call&amp;#39;d so loud, that all the hollow Deep Of Hell resounded. Princes, Potentates Warriers, the Flowr of Heav&amp;#39;n, once yours, now lost, If such astonishment as this can sieze Eternal spirits; or have ye chos&amp;#39;n this place After the toyl of Battel to repose Your wearied vertue, for the ease you find To slumber here, as in the Vales of Heav&amp;#39;n? Or in this abject posture have ye sworn To adore the Conquerour? who now beholds Cherube and Seraph rowling in the Flood With scatter&amp;#39;d Arms and Ensigns, till anon His swift pursuers from Heav&amp;#39;n Gates discern Th&amp;#39; advantage, and descending tread us down Thus drooping, or with linked Thunderbolts Transfix us to the bottom of this Gulfe. Awake, arise, or be for ever fall&amp;#39;n. They heard, and were abasht, and up they sprung Upon the wing, as when men wont to watch On duty, sleeping found by whom they dread, Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake. Nor did they not perceave the evil plight In which they were, or the fierce pains not feel; Yet to thir Generals Voyce they soon obeyd Innumerable. As when the potent Rod Of Amrams Son in Egypts evill day Wav&amp;#39;d round the Coast, up call&amp;#39;d a pitchy cloud Of Locusts, warping on the Eastern Wind, That ore the Realm of impious Pharaoh hung Like Night, and darken&amp;#39;d all the Land of Nile: So numberless were those bad Angels seen Hovering on wind under the Cope of Hell &amp;#39;Twixt upper, nether, and surrounding Fires; Till, as a signal giv&amp;#39;n, th&amp;#39; uplifted Spear Of thir great Sultan waving to direct Thir course, in even ballance down they light On the firm brimstone, and fill all the Plain; A multitude, like which the populous North Pour&amp;#39;d never from her frozen loyns, to pass Rhene or the Danaw, when her barbarous Sons Came like a Deluge on the South, and spread Beneath Gibralter to the Lybian sands. Forthwith from every Squadron and each Band The Heads and Leaders thither hast where stood Thir great Commander; Godlike shapes and forms Excelling human, Princely Dignities, And Powers that earst in Heaven sat on Thrones; Though of thir Names in heav&amp;#39;nly Records now Be no memorial blotted out and ras&amp;#39;d By thir Rebellion, from the Books of Life. Nor had they yet among the Sons of Eve Got them new Names, till wandring ore the Earth, Through Gods high sufferance for the tryal of man, By falsities and lyes the greatest part Of Mankind they corrupted to forsake God thir Creator, and th&amp;#39; invisible Glory of him that made them, to transform Oft to the Image of a Brute, adorn&amp;#39;d With gay Religions full of Pomp and Gold, And Devils to adore for Deities: Then were they known to men by various Names, And various Idols through the Heathen World. Say, Muse, the Names then known, who first, who last, Rous&amp;#39;d from the slumber, on that fiery Couch, At thir great Emperors call, as next in worth Came singly where he stood on the bare strand, While the promiscuous croud stood yet aloof? The chief were those who from the Pit of Hell Roaming to seek thir prey on earth, durst fix Thir Seats long after next the Seat of God, Thir Altars by his Altar, Gods ador&amp;#39;d Among the Nations round, and durst abide Jehovah thundring out of Sion, thron&amp;#39;d Between the Cherubim; yea, often plac&amp;#39;d Within his Sanctuary it self thir Shrines, Abominations; and with cursed things His holy Rites, and solemn Feasts profan&amp;#39;d, And with thir darkness durst affront his light. First Moloch, horrid King besmear&amp;#39;d with blood Of human sacrifice, and parents tears, Though for the noyse of Drums and Timbrels loud Thir childrens cries unheard, that past through fire To his grim Idol. Him the Ammonite Worshipt in Rabba and her watry Plain, In Argob and in Basan, to the stream Of utmost Arnon. Not content with such Audacious neighbourhood, the wisest heart Of Solomon he led by fraud to build His Temple right against the Temple of God On that opprobrious Hill, and made his Grove The pleasant Vally of Hinnom, Tophet thence And black Gehenna call&amp;#39;d, the Type of Hell. Next Chemos, th&amp;#39; obscene dread of Moabs Sons, From Aroar to Nebo, and the wild Of Southmost Abarim; in Hesebon And Heronaim, Seons Realm, beyond The flowry Dale of Sibma clad with Vines, And Eleale to th&amp;#39; Asphaltick Pool. Peor his other Name, when he entic&amp;#39;d Israel in Sittim on thir march from Nile To do him wanton rites, which cost them woe. Yet thence his lustful Orgies he enlarg&amp;#39;d Even to that Hill of scandal, but the Grove Of Moloch homicide, lust hard by hate; Till good Josiah drove them hence to Hell. With these cam they, who from the bordring flood Of old Euphrates to the Brook that parts Egypt from Syrian ground, had general names Of Baalim and Ashtaroth, those male, These Feminine. For Spirits when they please Can either Sex assume, or both; so soft And uncompounded is thir Essence pure, Nor ti&amp;#39;d or manacl&amp;#39;d with joynt or limb, Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones, Like cumbrous flesh; but in what shape they choose Dilated or condens&amp;#39;t, bright or obscure, Can execute thir aerie purposes, And works of love or enmity fulfill. For those the Race of Israel oft forsook Thir living strength, and unfrequented left His righteous Altar, bowing lowly down To bestial Gods; for which thir heads as low Bow&amp;#39;d down in Battel, sunk before the Spear Of despicable foes. With these in troop Came Astoreth, whom the Phoenicians call&amp;#39;d Astarte, Queen of Heav&amp;#39;n, with crescent Horns; To whose bright Image nightly by the Moon Sidonian Virgins paid thir Vows and Songs, In Sion also not unsung, where stood Her Temple on th&amp;#39; offensive Mountain, built By that uxorious King, whose heart though large, Beguil&amp;#39;d by fair Idolatresses, fell To idols foul. Thammuz came next behind, Whose annual wound in Lebanon allur&amp;#39;d The Syrian Damsels to lament his fate In amorous dittyes all a Summers day, While smooth Adonis from his native Rock Ran purple to the Sea, suppos&amp;#39;d with blood Of Thammuz yearly wounded; the Love-tale Infected Sions daughters with like heat, Whose wanton passions in the sacred Porch Ezekial saw, when by the Vision led His eye survay&amp;#39;d the dark Idolatries Of alienated Judah. Next came one Who mourn&amp;#39;d in earnest, when the Captive Ark Maim&amp;#39;d his brute Image, head and hands lopt off In his own Temple, on the grunsel edge, Where he fell flat, and sham&amp;#39;d his Worshipers: Dagon his Name, Sea Monster, upward Man And downward Fish: yet had his Temple high Rear&amp;#39;d in Azotus, dreaded through the Coast Of Palestine, in Gath and Ascalon And Accaron and Gaza&amp;#39;s frontier bounds. Him follow&amp;#39;d Rimmon, whose delightful Seat Was fair Damascus, on the fertil Banks Of Abbana and Pharphar, lucid streams. He also against the house of God was bold: A Leper once he lost and gain&amp;#39;d a King, Ahaz his sottish Conquerour, whom he drew Gods Altar to disparage and displace For one of Syrian mode, whereon to burn His odious offrings, and adore the Gods Whom he had vanquisht. After these appear&amp;#39;d A crew who under Names of old Renown, Osiris, Isis, Orus and thir Train With monstrous shapes and sorceries abus&amp;#39;d Fanatic Egypt and her Priests, to seek Thir wandring Gods Disguis&amp;#39;d in brutish forms Rather then human. Nor did Israel scape Th&amp;#39; infection when thir borrow&amp;#39;d Gold compos&amp;#39;d The Calf in Oreb: and the Rebel King Doubl&amp;#39;d that sin in Bethel and in Dan, Lik&amp;#39;ning his Maker to the Grazed Ox, Jehovah, who in one Night when he pass&amp;#39;d From Egypt marching, equal&amp;#39;d with one stroke Both her first born and all her bleating Gods Belial came last, then whom a Spirit more lewd Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love Vice for it self: To him no Temple stood Or Altar smoak&amp;#39;d; yet who more oft then hee In Temples and at Altars, when the Priest Turns Atheist, as did Ely&amp;#39;s Sons, who fill&amp;#39;d With lust and violence the house of God. In Courts and Palaces he also Reigns And in luxurious Cities, where the noyse Of riot ascends above thir loftiest Towrs, And injury and outrage: And when Night Darkens the Streets, then wander forth the Sons Of Belial, flown with insolence and wine. Witness the Streets of Sodom, and that night In Gibeah, when the hospitable door Expos&amp;#39;d a Matron to avoid worse rape. These were the prime in order and in might; The rest were long to tell, though far renown&amp;#39;d, Th&amp;#39; Ionian Gods, of Javans issue held Gods, yet confest later then Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth Thir boasted Parents; Tita\x08n Heav&amp;#39;ns first born With his enormous brood, and birthright seis&amp;#39;d By younger Saturn, he from mightier Jove His own and Rhea&amp;#39;s Son like measure found; So Jove usurping reign&amp;#39;d: these first in Creet And Ida known, thence on the Snowy top Of cold Olympus rul&amp;#39;d the middle Air Thir highest Heav&amp;#39;n; or on the Delphian Cliff, Or in Dodona, and through all the bounds Of Doric Land; or who with Saturn old Fled over Adria to th&amp;#39; Hesperian Fields, And ore the Celtic roam&amp;#39;d the utmost Isles. All these and more came flocking; but with looks Down cast and damp, yet such wherein appear&amp;#39;d Obscure some glimps of joy, to have found thir chief Not in despair, to have found themselves not lost In loss itself; which on his count&amp;#39;nance cast Like doubtful hue: but he his wonted pride Soon recollecting, with high words, that bore Semblance of worth, not substance, gently rais&amp;#39;d Thir fanting courage, and dispel&amp;#39;d thir fears. Then strait commands that at the warlike sound Of Trumpets loud and Clarions be upreard His mighty Standard; that proud honour claim&amp;#39;d Azazel as his right, a Cherube tall: Who forthwith from the glittering Staff unfurld Th&amp;#39; Imperial Ensign, which full high advanc&amp;#39;t Shon like a Meteor streaming to the Wind With Gemms and Golden lustre rich imblaz&amp;#39;d, Seraphic arms and Trophies: all the while Sonorous mettal blowing Martial sounds: At which the universal Host upsent A shout that tore Hells Concave, and beyond Frighted the Reign of Chaos and old Night. All in a moment through the gloom were seen Ten thousand Banners rise into the Air With Orient Colours waving: with them rose A Forrest huge of Spears: and thronging Helms Appear&amp;#39;d, and serried Shields in thick array Of depth immeasurable: Anon they move In perfect Phalanx to the Dorian mood Of Flutes and soft Recorders; such as rais&amp;#39;d To hight of noblest temper Hero&amp;#39;s old Arming to Battel, and in stead of rage Deliberate valour breath&amp;#39;d, firm and unmov&amp;#39;d With dread of death to flight or foul retreat, Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage With solemn touches, troubl&amp;#39;d thoughts, and chase Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain From mortal or immortal minds. Thus they Breathing united force with fixed thought Mov&amp;#39;d on in silence to soft Pipes that charm&amp;#39;d Thir painful steps o&amp;#39;re the burnt soyle; and now Advanc&amp;#39;t in view, they stand, a horrid Front Of dreadful length and dazling Arms, in guise Of Warriers old with order&amp;#39;d Spear and Shield, Awaiting what command thir mighty Chief Had to impose: He through the armed Files Darts his experienc&amp;#39;t eye, and soon traverse The whole Battalion views, thir order due, Thir visages and stature as of Gods, Thir number last he summs. And now his heart Distends with pride, and hardning in his strength Glories: For never since created man, Met such imbodied force, as nam&amp;#39;d with these Could merit more then that small infantry Warr&amp;#39;d on by Cranes: though all the Giant brood Of Phlegra with th&amp;#39; Heroic Race were joyn&amp;#39;d That fought at Theb&amp;#39;s and Ilium, on each side Mixt with auxiliar Gods; and what resounds In Fable or Romance of Uthers Sons Begirt with British and Armoric Knights; And all who since Baptiz&amp;#39;d or Infidel Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban, Damasco, or Marocco, or Trebisond Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore When Charlemain with all his Peerage fell By Fontarabbia. Thus far these beyond Compare of mortal prowess, yet observ&amp;#39;d Thir dread commander: he above the rest In shape and gesture proudly eminent Stood like a Towr; his form had yet not lost All her Original brightness, nor appear&amp;#39;d Less then Arch Angel ruind, and th&amp;#39; excess Of Glory obscur&amp;#39;d; As when the Sun new ris&amp;#39;n Looks through the Horizontal misty Air Shorn of his Beams, or from behind the Moon In dim Eclips disastrous twilight sheds On half the Nations, and with fear of change Perplexes Monarch. Dark&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;d so, yet shon Above them all th&amp;#39; Arch Angel; but his face Deep scars of Thunder had intrencht, and care Sat on his faded cheek, but under Browes Of dauntless courage, and considerate Pride Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast Signs of remorse and passion to behold The fellows of his crime, the followers rather (Far other once beheld in bliss) condemn&amp;#39;d For ever now to have thir lot in pain, Millions of Spirits for his fault amerc&amp;#39;t Of Heav&amp;#39;n, and from Eternal Splendors flung For his revolt, yet faithfull how they stood, Thir Glory witherd. As when Heavens Fire Hath scath&amp;#39;d the Forrest Oaks, or Mountain Pines, With singed top thir stately growth though bare Stands on the blasted Heath. He now prepar&amp;#39;d To speak; whereat thir doubl&amp;#39;d Ranks they bend From wing to wing, and half enclose him round With all his Peers: attention held them mute. Thrice he assayd, and thrice in spight of scorn, Tears such as Angels weep, burst forth: at last Words interwove with sighs found out thir way. O Myriads of immortal Spirits, O Powers Matchless, but with th&amp;#39; Almighty, and that strife Was not inglorious, though th&amp;#39; event was dire, As this place testifies, and this dire change Hateful to utter: but what power of mind Foreseeing or presaging, from the Depth Of knowledge past or present, could have fear&amp;#39;d, How such united force of Gods, how such As stood like these, could ever know repulse? For who can yet beleeve, though after loss, That all these puissant Legions, whose exile Hath emptied Heav&amp;#39;n, shall fail to re-ascend Self-rais&amp;#39;d, and repossess thir native seat? For mee be witness all the Host of Heav&amp;#39;n, If counsels different, or danger shun&amp;#39;d By mee, have lost our hopes. But he who reigns Monarch in Heav&amp;#39;n, till then as one secure Sat on his Throne, upheld by old repute, Consent or custome, and his Regal State Put forth at full, but still his strength conceal&amp;#39;d, Which tempted our attempt, and wrought our fall. Henceforth his might we know, and know our own So as not either to provoke, or dread New warr, provok&amp;#39;t; our better part remains To work in close design, by fraud or guile What force effected not: that he no less At length from us may find, who overcomes By force, hath overcome but half his foe. Space may produce new Worlds; whereof so rife There went a fame in Heav&amp;#39;n that he ere long Intended to create, and therein plant A generation, whom his choice regard Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven: Thither, if but to pry, shall be perhaps Our first eruption, thither or elsewhere: For this Infernal Pit shall never hold Caelestial Spirits in Bondage, nor th&amp;#39; Abyss Long under darkness cover. But these thoughts Full Counsel must mature: Peace is despaird, For who can think Submission? Warr then, Warr Open or understood must be resolv&amp;#39;d. He spake: and to confirm his words, out-flew Millions of flaming swords, drawn from the thighs Of mighty Cherubim; the sudden blaze Far round illumin&amp;#39;d hell: highly they rag&amp;#39;d Against the Highest, and fierce with grasped Arms Clash&amp;#39;d on thir sounding Shields the din of war, Hurling defiance toward the Vault of Heav&amp;#39;n. There stood a hill not far whose griesly top Belch&amp;#39;d fire and rowling smoak; the rest entire Shon with a glossie scurff, undoubted sign That in his womb was hid metallic Ore, The work of Sulphur. Thither wing&amp;#39;d with speed A numerous Brigad hasten&amp;#39;d. As when Bands Of Pioners with Spade and Pickax arm&amp;#39;d Forerun the Royal Camp, to trench a Field, Or cast a Rampart. Mammon led them on, Mammon, the least erected Spirit that fell From heav&amp;#39;n, for ev&amp;#39;n in heav&amp;#39;n his looks and thoughts Were always downward bent, admiring more The riches of Heav&amp;#39;ns pavement, trod&amp;#39;n Gold, Then aught divine or holy else enjoy&amp;#39;d In vision beatific: by him first Men also, and by his suggestion taught Ransack&amp;#39;d the Center, and with impious hands Rifl&amp;#39;d the bowels of thir mother Earth For Treasures better hid. Soon had his crew Op&amp;#39;nd into the Hill a spacious wound And dig&amp;#39;d out ribs of Gold. Let none admire That riches grow in Hell; that soyle may best Deserve the precious bane. And here let those Who boast in mortal things, and wond&amp;#39;ring tell Of Babel, and the works of Memphian Kings Learn how thir greatest Monuments of Fame, And Strength and Art are easily out-done By Spirits reprobate, and in an hour What in an age they with incessant toyle And hands innumerable scarce perform. Nigh on the Plain in many cells prepar&amp;#39;d That underneath had veins of liquid fire Sluc&amp;#39;d from the Lake, a second multitude With wond&amp;#39;rous Art found out the massie Ore, Severing each kind, and scum&amp;#39;d the Bullion dross: A third as soon had form&amp;#39;d within the ground A various mould, and from the boyling cells By strange conveyance fill&amp;#39;d each hollow nook, As in an Organ from one blast of wind To many a row of Pipes the sound-board breaths. Anon out of the earth a Fabrick huge Rose like an Exhalation, with the sound Of Dulcet Symphonies and voices sweet, Built like a Temple, where Pilasters round Were set, and Doric pillars overlaid With Golden Architrave; nor did there want Cornice or Freeze, with bossy Sculptures grav&amp;#39;n, The Roof was fretted Gold. Not Babilon, Nor great Alcairo such magnificence Equal&amp;#39;d in all thir glories, to inshrine Belus or Serapis thir Gods, or seat Thir Kings, when Aegypt with Assyria strove In wealth and luxurie. Th&amp;#39; ascending pile Stood fixt her stately highth, and strait the dores Op&amp;#39;ning thir brazen foulds discover wide Within, her ample spaces, o&amp;#39;re the smooth And level pavement: from the arched roof Pendant by suttle Magic many a row Of Starry Lamps and blazing Cressets fed With Naphtha and Asphaltus yeilded light As from a sky. The hasty multitude Admiring enter&amp;#39;d, and the work some praise And some the Architect: his hand was known In Heav&amp;#39;n by many a Towred structure high, Where Scepter&amp;#39;d Angels held thir residence, And sat as Princes, whom the supreme King Exalted to such power, and gave to rule, Each in his Hierarchie, the Orders bright. Nor was his name unheard or unador&amp;#39;d In ancient Greece; and in Ausonian land Men call&amp;#39;d him Mulciber; and how he fell From Heav&amp;#39;n, they fabl&amp;#39;d, thrown by angry Jove Sheer o&amp;#39;re the Chrystal Battlements; from Morn To Noon he fell, from Noon to dewy Eve, A Summers day; and with the setting Sun Dropt from the Zenith like a falling Star, On Lemnos th&amp;#39; Aegaean Ile: thus they relate, Erring; for he with this rebellious rout Fell long before; nor aught avail&amp;#39;d him now To have built in Heav&amp;#39;n high Towrs; nor did he scape By all his Engins, but was headlong sent With his industrious crew to build in hell. Mean while the winged Haralds by command Of Sovran power, with awful Ceremony And Trumpets sound throughout the Host proclaim A solemn Councel forthwith to be held At Pandaemonium, the high Capital Of Satan and his Peers: thir summons call&amp;#39;d From every Band and squared Regiment By place or choice the worthiest; they anon With hunderds and with thousands trooping came Attended: all access was throng&amp;#39;d, the Gates And Porches wide, but chief the spacious Hall (Though like a cover&amp;#39;d field, where Champions bold Wont ride in arm&amp;#39;d, and at the Soldans chair Defi&amp;#39;d the best of Panim chivalry To mortal combat or carreer with Lance) Thick swarm&amp;#39;d, both on the ground and in the air, Brusht with the hiss of russling wings. As Bees In spring time, when the Sun with Taurus rides, Pour forth thir populous youth about the Hive In clusters; they among fresh dews and flowers Flie to and fro, or on the smoothed Plank, The suburb of thir Straw-built Cittadel, New rub&amp;#39;d with Baum, expatiate and confer Thir State affairs. So thick the aerie crowd Swarm&amp;#39;d and were straitn&amp;#39;d; till the Signal giv&amp;#39;n Behold a wonder! they but now who seemd In bigness to surpass Earths Giant Sons Now less then smallest Dwarfs, in narrow room Throng numberless, like that Pigmean Race Beyond the Indian Mount, or Faerie Elves, Whose midnight Revels, by a Forrest side Or Fountain some belated Peasant sees, Or dreams he sees, while over-head the Moon Sits Arbitress, and neerer to the Earth Wheels her pale course, they on thir mirth and dance Intent, with jocond Music charm his ear; At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds. Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms Reduc&amp;#39;d thir shapes immense, and were at large, Though without number still amidst the Hall Of that infernal Court. But far within And in thir own dimensions like themselves The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim In close recess and secret conclave sat A thousand Demy-Gods on golden seat&amp;#39;s, Frequent and full. After short silence then And summons read, the great consult began.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;MEanwhile the hainous and despightfull act Of Satan done in Paradise, and how Hee in the Serpent, had perverted Eve, Her Husband shee, to taste the fatall fruit, Was known in Heav&amp;#39;n; for what can scape the Eye Of God All-seeing, or deceave his Heart Omniscient, who in all things wise and just, Hinder&amp;#39;d not Satan to attempt the minde Of Man, with strength entire, and free will arm&amp;#39;d, Complete to have discover&amp;#39;d and repulst Whatever wiles of Foe or seeming Friend. For still they knew, and ought to have still remember&amp;#39;d The high Injunction not to taste that Fruit, Whoever tempted; which they not obeying, Incurr&amp;#39;d, what could they less, the penaltie, And manifold in sin, deserv&amp;#39;d to fall. Up into Heav&amp;#39;n from Paradise in haste Th&amp;#39; Angelic Guards ascended, mute and sad For Man, for of his state by this they knew, Much wondring how the suttle Fiend had stoln Entrance unseen. Soon as th&amp;#39; unwelcome news From Earth arriv&amp;#39;d at Heaven Gate, displeas&amp;#39;d All were who heard, dim sadness did not spare That time Celestial visages, yet mixt With pitie, violated not thir bliss. About the new-arriv&amp;#39;d, in multitudes Th&amp;#39; ethereal People ran, to hear and know How all befell: they towards the Throne Supream Accountable made haste to make appear With righteous plea, thir utmost vigilance, And easily approv&amp;#39;d; when the most High Eternal Father from his secret Cloud, Amidst in Thunder utter&amp;#39;d thus his voice. Assembl&amp;#39;d Angels, and ye Powers return&amp;#39;d From unsuccessful charge, be not dismaid, Nor troubl&amp;#39;d at these tidings from the Earth, Which your sincerest care could not prevent, Foretold so lately what would come to pass, When first this Tempter cross&amp;#39;d the Gulf from Hell. I told ye then he should prevail and speed On his bad Errand, Man should be seduc&amp;#39;t And flatter&amp;#39;d out of all, believing lies Against his Maker; no Decree of mine Concurring to necessitate his Fall, Or touch with lightest moment of impulse His free Will, to her own inclining left In eevn scale. But fall&amp;#39;n he is, and now What rests but that the mortal Sentence pass On his transgression, Death denounc&amp;#39;t that day, Which he presumes already vain and void, Because not yet inflicted, as he fear&amp;#39;d, By some immediate stroak; but soon shall find Forbearance no acquittance ere day end. Justice shall not return as bountie scorn&amp;#39;d. But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee Vicegerent Son, to thee I have transferr&amp;#39;d All Judgement, whether in Heav&amp;#39;n, or Earth, or Hell. Easie it might be seen that I intend Mercie collegue with Justice, sending thee Mans Friend, his Mediator, his design&amp;#39;d Both Ransom and Redeemer voluntarie, And destin&amp;#39;d Man himself to judge Man fall&amp;#39;n. So spake the Father, and unfoulding bright Toward the right hand his Glorie, on the Son Blaz&amp;#39;d forth unclouded Deitie; he full Resplendent all his Father manifest Express&amp;#39;d, and thus divinely answer&amp;#39;d milde. Father Eternal, thine is to decree, Mine both in Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth to do thy will Supream, that thou in mee thy Son belov&amp;#39;d Mayst ever rest well pleas&amp;#39;d. I go to judge On Earth these thy transgressors, but thou knowst, Whoever judg&amp;#39;d, the worst on mee must light, When time shall be, for so I undertook Before thee; and not repenting, this obtaine Of right, that I may mitigate thir doom On me deriv&amp;#39;d, yet I shall temper so Justice with Mercie, as may illustrate most Them fully satisfied, and thee appease. Attendance none shall need, nor Train, where none Are to behold the Judgment, but the judg&amp;#39;d, Those two; the third best absent is condemn&amp;#39;d, Convict by flight, and Rebel to all Law Conviction to the Serpent none belongs. Thus saying, from his radiant Seat he rose Of high collateral glorie: him Thrones and Powers, Princedoms, and Dominations ministrant Accompanied to Heaven Gate, from whence Eden and all the Coast in prospect lay. Down he descended strait; the speed of Gods Time counts not, though with swiftest minutes wing&amp;#39;d. Now was the Sun in Western cadence low From Noon, and gentle Aires due at thir hour To fan the Earth now wak&amp;#39;d, and usher in The Eevning coole when he from wrauth more coole Came the mild Judge and Intercessor both To sentence Man: the voice of God they heard Now walking in the Garden, by soft windes Brought to thir Ears, while day declin&amp;#39;d, they heard, And from his presence hid themselves among The thickest Trees, both Man and Wife, till God Approaching, thus to Adam call&amp;#39;d aloud. Where art thou Adam, wont with joy to meet My coming seen far off? I miss thee here, Not pleas&amp;#39;d, thus entertaind with solitude, Where obvious dutie erewhile appear&amp;#39;d unsaught: Or come I less conspicuous, or what change Absents thee, or what chance detains? Come forth. He came, and with him Eve, more loth, though first To offend, discount&amp;#39;nanc&amp;#39;t both, and discompos&amp;#39;d; Love was not in thir looks, either to God Or to each other, but apparent guilt, And shame, and perturbation, and despaire, Anger, and obstinacie, and hate, and guile. Whence Adam faultring long, thus answer&amp;#39;d brief. I heard thee in the Garden, and of thy voice Affraid, being naked, hid my self. To whom The gracious judge without revile repli&amp;#39;d. My voice thou oft hast heard, and hast not fear&amp;#39;d, But still rejoyc&amp;#39;t, how is it now become So dreadful to thee? that thou art naked, who Hath told thee? hast thou eaten of the Tree Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat? To whom thus Adam sore beset repli&amp;#39;d. O Heav&amp;#39;n! in evil strait this day I stand Before my judge, either to undergoe My self the total Crime, or to accuse My other self, the partner of my life; Whose failing, while her Faith to me remaines, I should conceal, and not expose to blame By my complaint; but strict necessitie Subdues me, and calamitous constraint Least on my head both sin and punishment, However insupportable, be all Devolv&amp;#39;d; though should I hold my peace, yet thou Wouldst easily detect what I conceale. This Woman whom thou mad&amp;#39;st to be my help, And gav&amp;#39;st me as thy perfet gift, so good, So fit, so acceptable, so Divine, That from her hand I could suspect no ill, And what she did, whatever in it self, Her doing seem&amp;#39;d to justifie the deed; Shee gave me of the Tree, and I did eate. To whom the sovran Presence thus repli&amp;#39;d. Was shee thy God, that her thou didst obey Before his voice, or was shee made thy guide, Superior, or but equal, that to her Thou did&amp;#39;st resigne thy Manhood, and the Place Wherein God set thee above her made of thee, And for thee, whose perfection farr excell&amp;#39;d Hers in all real dignitie: Adornd Shee was indeed, and lovely to attract Thy Love, not thy Subjection, and her Gifts Were such as under Government well seem&amp;#39;d, Unseemly to beare rule, which was thy part And person, had&amp;#39;st thou known thy self aright. So having said, he thus to Eve in few: Say Woman, what is this which thou hast done? To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelm&amp;#39;d, Confessing soon, yet not before her judge Bold or loquacious, thus abasht repli&amp;#39;d. The Serpent me beguil&amp;#39;d and I did eate. Which when the Lord God heard, without delay To Judgement he proceeded on th&amp;#39; accus&amp;#39;d Serpent though brute, unable to transferre The Guilt on him who made him instrument Of mischief, and polluted from the end Of his Creation; justly then accurst, As vitiated in Nature: more to know Concern&amp;#39;d not Man (since he no further knew) Nor alter&amp;#39;d his offence; yet God at last To Satan first in sin his doom apply&amp;#39;d, Though in mysterious terms, judg&amp;#39;d as then best: And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall. Because thou hast done this, thou art accurst Above all Cattle, each Beast of the Field; Upon thy Belly groveling thou shalt goe, And dust shalt eat all the dayes of thy Life. Between Thee and the Woman I will put Enmitie, and between thine and her Seed; Her Seed shall bruse thy head, thou bruise his heel. So spake this Oracle, then verifi&amp;#39;d When Jesus son of Mary second Eve, Saw Satan fall like Lightning down from Heav&amp;#39;n, Prince of the Aire; then rising from his Grave Spoild Principalities and Powers, triumpht In open shew, and with ascention bright Captivity led captive through the Aire, The Realm it self of Satan long usurpt, Whom he shall tread at last under our feet; Eeven hee who now foretold his fatal bruise, And to the Woman thus his Sentence turn&amp;#39;d. Thy sorrow I will greatly multiplie By thy Conception; Children thou shalt bring In sorrow forth, and to thy Husbands will Thine shall submit, hee over thee shall rule. On Adam last thus judgement he pronounc&amp;#39;d. Because thou hast heark&amp;#39;nd to the voice of thy Wife, And eaten of the Tree concerning which I charg&amp;#39;d thee, saying: Thou shalt not eate thereof, Curs&amp;#39;d is the ground for thy sake, thou in sorrow Shalt eate thereof all the days of thy Life; Thorns also and Thistles it shall bring thee forth Unbid, and thou shalt eate th&amp;#39; Herb of th&amp;#39; Field, In the sweat of thy Face shalt thou eat Bread, Till thou return unto the ground, for thou Out of the ground wast taken, know thy Birth, For dust thou art, and shalt to dust returne. So judg&amp;#39;d he Man, both Judge and Saviour sent, And th&amp;#39; instant stroke of Death denounc&amp;#39;t that day Remov&amp;#39;d farr off; then pittying how they stood Before him naked to the aire, that now Must suffer change, disdain&amp;#39;d not to begin Thenceforth the form of servant to assume, As when he wash&amp;#39;d his servants feet so now As Father of his Familie he clad Thir nakedness with Skins of Beasts, or slain, Or as the Snake with youthful Coate repaid; And thought not much to cloath his Enemies: Nor hee thir outward onely with the Skins Of Beasts, but inward nakedness, much more Opprobrious, with his Robe of righteousness, Araying cover&amp;#39;d from his Fathers sight. To him with swift ascent he up returnd, Into his blissful bosom reassum&amp;#39;d In glory as of old, to him appeas&amp;#39;d All, though all-knowing, what had past with Man Recounted, mixing intercession sweet. Meanwhile ere thus was sin&amp;#39;d and judg&amp;#39;d on Earth, Within the Gates of Hell sate Sin and Death, In counterview within the Gates, that now Stood open wide, belching outrageous flame Farr into Chaos, since the Fiend pass&amp;#39;d through, Sin opening, who thus now to Death began. O Son, why sit we here each other viewing Idlely, while Satan our great Author thrives In other Worlds, and happier Seat provides For us his ofspring deare; It cannot be But that success attends him; if mishap, Ere this he had return&amp;#39;d, with fury driv&amp;#39;n By his Avenger, since no place like this Can fit his punishment, or their revenge. Methinks I feel new strength within me rise, Wings growing, and Dominion giv&amp;#39;n me large Beyond this Deep; whatever drawes me on, Or sympathie, or som connatural force Powerful at greatest distance to unite With secret amity things of like kinde By secretest conveyance. Thou my Shade Inseparable must with mee along: For Death from Sin no power can separate. But least the difficultie of passing back Stay his return perhaps over this Gulfe Impassable, Impervious, let us try Adventrous work, yet to thy power and mine Not unagreeable, to found a path Over this Maine from Hell to that new World Where Satan now prevailes, a Monument Of merit high to all th&amp;#39; infernal Host, Easing thir passage hence, for intercourse, Or transmigration, as thir lot shall lead. Nor can I miss the way, so strongly drawn By this new felt attraction and instinct. Whom thus the meager Shadow answerd soon. Goe whither Fate and inclination strong Leads thee, I shall not lag behinde, nor erre The way, thou leading, such a sent I draw Of carnage, prey innumerable, and taste The savour of Death from all things there that live: Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest Be wanting, but afford thee equal aid. So saying, with delight he snuff&amp;#39;d the smell Of mortal change on Earth. As when a flock Of ravenous Fowl, though many a League remote, Against the day of Battel, to a Field, Where Armies lie encampt, come flying, lur&amp;#39;d With sent of living Carcasses design&amp;#39;d For death, the following day, in bloodie fight. So sented the grim Feature, and upturn&amp;#39;d His Nostril wide into the murkie Air, Sagacious of his Quarry from so farr. Then Both from out Hell Gates into the waste Wide Anarchie of Chaos damp and dark Flew divers, and with Power (thir Power was great) Hovering upon the Waters; what they met Solid or slimie, as in raging Sea Tost up and down, together crowded drove From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell. As when two Polar Winds blowing adverse Upon the Cronian Sea, together drive Mountains of Ice, that stop th&amp;#39; imagin&amp;#39;d way Beyond Petsora Eastward, to the rich Cathaian Coast. The aggregated Soyle Death with his Mace petrific, cold and dry, As with a Trident smote, and fix&amp;#39;t as firm As Delos floating once; the rest his look Bound with Gorgonian rigor not to move, And with Asphaltic slime; broad as the Gate, Deep to the Roots of Hell the gather&amp;#39;d beach They fasten&amp;#39;d, and the Mole immense wraught on Over the foaming deep high Archt, a Bridge Of length prodigious joyning to the Wall Immovable of this now fenceless world Forfeit to Death; from hence a passage broad, Smooth, easie, inoffensive down to Hell. So, if great things to small may be compar&amp;#39;d, Xerxes, the Libertie of Greece to yoke, From Susa his Memnonian Palace high Came to the Sea, and over Hellespont Bridging his way, Europe with Asia joyn&amp;#39;d, And scourg&amp;#39;d with many a stroak th&amp;#39; indignant waves. Now had they brought the work by wondrous Art Pontifical, a ridge of pendent Rock Over the vext Abyss, following the track Of Satan, to the self same place where hee First lighted from his Wing, and landed safe From out of Chaos to the out side bare Of this round World: with Pinns of Adamant And Chains they made all fast, too fast they made And durable; and now in little space The confines met of Empyrean Heav&amp;#39;n And of this World, and on the left hand Hell With long reach interpos&amp;#39;d; three sev&amp;#39;ral wayes In sight, to each of these three places led. And now thir way to Earth they had descri&amp;#39;d, To Paradise first tending, when behold Satan in likeness of an Angel bright Betwixt the Centaure and the Scorpion stearing His Zenith, while the Sun in Aries rose: Disguis&amp;#39;d he came, but those his Children dear Thir Parent soon discern&amp;#39;d, though in disguise. Hee after Eve seduc&amp;#39;t, unminded slunk Into the Wood fast by, and changing shape To observe the sequel, saw his guileful act By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded Upon her Husband, saw thir shame that sought Vain covertures; but when he saw descend The Son of God to judge them terrifi&amp;#39;d Hee fled, not hoping to escape, but shun The present, fearing guiltie what his wrauth Might suddenly inflict; that past, return&amp;#39;d By Night, and listening where the hapless Paire Sate in thir sad discourse, and various plaint, Thence gatherd his own doom, which understood Not instant, but of future time. With joy And tidings fraught, to Hell he now return&amp;#39;d, And at the brink of Chaos, neer the foot Of this new wondrous Pontifice, unhop&amp;#39;t Met who to meet him came, his Ofspring dear. Great joy was at thir meeting, and at sight Of that stupendious Bridge his joy encreas&amp;#39;d. Long hee admiring stood, till Sin, his faire Inchanting Daughter, thus the silence broke. O Parent, these are thy magnific deeds, Thy Trophies, which thou view&amp;#39;st as not thine own, Thou art thir Author and prime Architect: For I no sooner in my Heart divin&amp;#39;d, My Heart, which by a secret harmonie Still moves with thine, join&amp;#39;d in connexion sweet, That thou on Earth hadst prosper&amp;#39;d, which thy looks Now also evidence, but straight I felt Though distant from thee Worlds between, yet felt That I must after thee with this thy Son; Such fatal consequence unites us three: Hell could no longer hold us in her bounds, Nor this unvoyageable Gulf obscure Detain from following thy illustrious track. Thou hast atchiev&amp;#39;d our libertie, confin&amp;#39;d Within Hell Gates till, now, thou us impow&amp;#39;rd To fortifie thus farr, and overlay With this portentous Bridge the dark Abyss. Thine now is all this World, thy vertue hath won What thy hands builded not, thy Wisdom gain&amp;#39;d With odds what Warr hath lost, and fully aveng&amp;#39;d Our foile in Heav&amp;#39;n; here thou shalt Monarch reign, There didst not; there let him still Victor sway, As Battel hath adjudg&amp;#39;d, from this new World Retiring, by his own doom alienated, And henceforth Monarchie with thee divide Of all things parted by th&amp;#39; Empyreal bounds, His Quadrature, from thy Orbicular World, Or trie thee now more dang&amp;#39;rous to his Throne. Whom thus the Prince of Darkness answerd glad. Fair Daughter, and thou Son and Grandchild both, High proof ye now have giv&amp;#39;n to be the Race Of Satan (for I glorie in the name, Antagonist of Heav&amp;#39;ns Almightie King) Amply have merited of me, of all Th&amp;#39; infernal Empire, that so neer Heav&amp;#39;ns dore Triumphal with triumphal act have met, Mine with this glorious Work, and made one Realm Hell and this World, one Realm, one Continent Of easie thorough-fare. Therefore while I Descend through Darkness, on your Rode with ease To my associate Powers, them to acquaint With these successes, and with them rejoyce, You two this way, among these numerous Orbs All yours, right down to Paradise descend; There dwell and Reign in bliss, thence on the Earth Dominion exercise and in the Aire, Chiefly on Man, sole Lord of all declar&amp;#39;d, Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill. My Substitutes I send ye, and Create Plenipotent on Earth, of matchless might Issuing from mee: on your joynt vigor now My hold of this new Kingdom all depends, Through Sin to Death expos&amp;#39;d by my exploit. If your joynt power prevailes, th&amp;#39; affaires of Hell No detriment need feare, goe and be strong. So saying he dismiss&amp;#39;d them, they with speed Thir course through thickest Constellations held Spreading thir bane; the blasted Starrs lookt wan, And Planets, Planet-strook, real Eclips Then sufferd. Th&amp;#39; other way Satan went down The Causey to Hell Gate; on either side Disparted Chaos over built exclaimd, And with rebounding surge the barrs assaild, That scorn&amp;#39;d his indignation: through the Gate, Wide open and unguarded, Satan pass&amp;#39;d, And all about found desolate; for those Appointed to sit there, had left thir charge, Flown to the upper World; the rest were all Farr to the inland retir&amp;#39;d, about the walls Of Pandaemonium, Citie and proud seate Of Lucifer, so by allusion calld, Of that bright Starr to Satan paragond. There kept thir Watch the Legions, while the Grand In Council sate, sollicitous what chance Might intercept thir Emperour sent, so hee Departing gave command, and they observ&amp;#39;d. As when the Tartar from his Russian Foe By Astracan over the Snowie Plaines Retires, or Bactrian Sophi from the hornes Of Turkish Crescent, leaves all waste beyond The Realm of Aladule, in his retreate To Tauris or Casbeen. So these the late Heav&amp;#39;n-banisht Host, left desert utmost Hell Many a dark League, reduc&amp;#39;t in careful Watch Round thir Metropolis, and now expecting Each hour their great adventurer from the search Of Forrein Worlds: he through the midst unmarkt, In shew Plebeian Angel militant Of lowest order, past; and from the dore Of that Plutonian Hall, invisible Ascended his high Throne, which under state Of richest texture spred, at th&amp;#39; upper end Was plac&amp;#39;t in regal lustre. Down a while He sate, and round about him saw unseen: At last as from a Cloud his fulgent head And shape Starr bright appeer&amp;#39;d, or brighter, clad With what permissive glory since his fall Was left him, or false glitter: All amaz&amp;#39;d At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng Bent thir aspect, and whom they wish&amp;#39;d beheld, Thir mighty Chief returnd: loud was th&amp;#39; acclaime: Forth rush&amp;#39;d in haste the great consulting Peers, Rais&amp;#39;d from thir Dark Divan, and with like joy Congratulant approach&amp;#39;d him, who with hand Silence, and with these words attention won. Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers, For in possession such, not onely of right, I call ye and declare ye now, returnd Successful beyond hope, to lead ye forth Triumphant out of this infernal Pit Abominable, accurst, the house of woe, And Dungeon of our Tyrant: Now possess, As Lords, a spacious World, to our native Heaven Little inferiour, by my adventure hard With peril great atchiev&amp;#39;d. Long were to tell What I have don, what sufferd, with what paine Voyag&amp;#39;d th&amp;#39; unreal, vast, unbounded deep Of horrible confusion, over which By Sin and Death a broad way now is pav&amp;#39;d To expedite your glorious march; but I Toild out my uncouth passage, forc&amp;#39;t to ride Th&amp;#39; untractable Abysse, plung&amp;#39;d in the womb Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wilde, That jealous of thir secrets fiercely oppos&amp;#39;d My journey strange, with clamorous uproare Protesting Fate supreame; thence how I found The new created World, which fame in Heav&amp;#39;n Long had foretold, a Fabrick wonderful Of absolute perfection, therein Man Plac&amp;#39;t in a Paradise, by our exile Made happie; Him by fraud I have seduc&amp;#39;d From his Creator, and the more to increase Your wonder, with an Apple; he thereat Offended, worth your laughter, hath giv&amp;#39;n up Both his beloved Man and all his World, To Sin and Death a prey, and so to us, Without our hazard, labour, or allarme, To range in, and to dwell, and over Man To rule, as over all he should have rul&amp;#39;d. True is, mee also he hath judg&amp;#39;d, or rather Mee not, but the brute Serpent in whose shape Man I deceav&amp;#39;d: that which to mee belongs, Is enmity, which he will put between Mee and Mankinde; I am to bruise his heel; His Seed, when is not set, shall bruise my head: A World who would not purchase with a bruise, Or much more grievous pain? Ye have th&amp;#39; account Of my performance: What remains, ye Gods, But up and enter now into full bliss. So having said, a while he stood, expecting Thir universal shout and high applause To fill his eare, when contrary he hears On all sides, from innumerable tongues A dismal universal hiss, the sound Of public scorn; he wonderd, but not long Had leasure, wondring at himself now more; His Visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare, His Armes clung to his Ribs, his Leggs entwining Each other, till supplanted down he fell A monstrous Serpent on his Belly prone, Reluctant, but in vaine, a greater power Now rul&amp;#39;d him, punisht in the shape he sin&amp;#39;d, According to his doom: he would have spoke, But hiss for hiss returnd with forked tongue To forked tongue, for now were all transform&amp;#39;d Alike, to Serpents all as accessories To his bold Riot: dreadful was the din Of hissing through the Hall, thick swarming now With complicated monsters head and taile, Scorpion and Asp, and Amphisbaena dire, Cerastes hornd, Hydrus, and Ellops drear, And Dipsas (not so thick swarm&amp;#39;d once the Soil Bedropt with blood of Gorgon, or the Isle Ophiusa) but still greatest hee the midst, Now Dragon grown, larger then whom the Sun Ingenderd in the Pythian Vale on slime, Huge Python, and his Power no less he seem&amp;#39;d Above the rest still to retain; they all Him follow&amp;#39;d issuing forth to th&amp;#39; open Field, Where all yet left of that revolted Rout Heav&amp;#39;n-fall&amp;#39;n, in station stood or just array, Sublime with expectation when to see ln Triumph issuing forth thir glorious Chief; They saw, but other sight instead, a crowd Of ugly Serpents; horror on them fell, And horrid sympathie; for what they saw, They felt themselvs now changing; down thir arms, Down fell both Spear and Shield, down they as fast, And the dire hiss renew&amp;#39;d, and the dire form Catcht by Contagion, like in punishment, As in thir crime. Thus was th&amp;#39; applause they meant, Turnd to exploding hiss, triumph to shame Cast on themselves from thir own mouths. There stood A Grove hard by, sprung up with this thir change, His will who reigns above, to aggravate Thir penance, laden with Fruit like that Which grew in Paradise, the bait of Eve Us&amp;#39;d by the Tempter: on that prospect strange Thir earnest eyes they fix&amp;#39;d, imagining For one forbidden Tree a multitude Now ris&amp;#39;n, to work them furder woe or shame; Yet parcht with scalding thurst and hunger fierce, Though to delude them sent, could not abstain, But on they rould in heaps, and up the Trees Climbing, sat thicker then the snakie locks That curld Megaera: greedily they pluck&amp;#39;d The Frutage fair to sight, like that which grew Neer that bituminous Lake where Sodom flam&amp;#39;d; This more delusive, not the touch, but taste Deceav&amp;#39;d; they fondly thinking to allay Thir appetite with gust, instead of Fruit Chewd bitter Ashes, which th&amp;#39; offended taste With spattering noise rejected: oft they assayd, Hunger and thirst constraining, drugd as oft, With hatefullest disrelish writh&amp;#39;d thir jaws With soot and cinders fill&amp;#39;d; so oft they fell Into the same illusion, not as Man Whom they triumph&amp;#39;d once lapst. Thus were they plagu&amp;#39;d And worn with Famin, long and ceasless hiss, Till thir lost shape, permitted, they resum&amp;#39;d, Yearly enjoynd, some say, to undergo This annual humbling certain number&amp;#39;d days, To dash thir pride, and joy for Man seduc&amp;#39;t. However some tradition they dispers&amp;#39;d Among the Heathen of thir purchase got, And Fabl&amp;#39;d how the Serpent, whom they calld Ophion with Eurynome, the wide- Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule Of high Olympus, thence by Saturn driv&amp;#39;n And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born. Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair Too soon arriv&amp;#39;d, Sin there in power before, Once actual, now in body, and to dwell Habitual habitant; behind her Death Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet On his pale Horse: to whom Sin thus began. Second of Satan sprung, all conquering Death, What thinkst thou of our Empire now, though earnd With travail difficult, not better farr Then stil at Hels dark threshold to have sate watch, Unnam&amp;#39;d, undreaded, and thy self half starv&amp;#39;d? Whom thus the Sin-born Monster answerd soon. To mee, who with eternal Famin pine, Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven, There best, where most with ravin I may meet; Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems To stuff this Maw, this vast unhide-bound Corps. To whom th&amp;#39; incestuous Mother thus repli&amp;#39;d. Thou therefore on these Herbs, and Fruits, and Flours Feed first, on each Beast next, and Fish, and Fowle, No homely morsels, and whatever thing The Sithe of Time mowes down, devour unspar&amp;#39;d, Till I in Man residing through the Race, His thoughts, his looks, words, actions all infect, And season him thy last and sweetest prey. This said, they both betook them several wayes, Both to destroy, or unimmortal make All kinds, and for destruction to mature Sooner or later; which th&amp;#39; Almightie seeing, From his transcendent Seat the Saints among, To those bright Orders utterd thus his voice. See with what heat these Dogs of Hell advance To waste and havoc yonder World, which I So fair and good created, and had still Kept in that State, had not the folly of Man Let in these wastful Furies, who impute Folly to mee, so doth the Prince of Hell And his Adherents, that with so much ease I suffer them to enter and possess A place so heav&amp;#39;nly, and conniving-seem To gratifie my scornful Enemies, That laugh, as if transported with some fit Of Passion, I to them had quitted all, At random yielded up to their misrule; And know not that I call&amp;#39;d and drew them thither My Hell-hounds, to lick up the draff and filth Which mans polluting Sin with taint hath shed On what was pure, till cramm&amp;#39;d and gorg&amp;#39;d, nigh burst With suckt and glutted offal, at one sling Of thy victorious Arm, well-pleasing Son, Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave at last Through Chaos hurld, obstruct the mouth of Hell For ever, and seal up his ravenous Jawes. Then Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth renewd shall be made pure To sanctitie that shall receive no staine: Till then the Curse pronounc&amp;#39;t on both precedes. He ended, and the heav&amp;#39;nly Audience loud Sung Halleluia, as the sound of Seas, Through multitude that sung: Just are thy ways, Righteous are thy Decrees on all thy Works; Who can extenuate thee? Next, to the Son, Destin&amp;#39;d restorer of Mankind, by whom New Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth shall to the Ages rise, Or down from Heav&amp;#39;n descend. Such was thir song, While the Creator calling forth by name His mightie Angels gave them several charge, As sorted best with present things. The Sun Had first his precept so to move, so shine, As might affect the Earth with cold and heat Scarce tollerable, and from the North to call Decrepit Winter, from the South to bring Solstitial summers heat. To the blanc Moone Her office they prescrib&amp;#39;d, to th&amp;#39; other five Thir planetarie motions and aspects In Sextile, Square, and Trine, and Opposite, Of noxious efficacie, and when to joyne In Synod unbenigne, and taught the fixt Thir influence malignant when to showre, Which of them rising with the Sun, or falling, Should prove tempestuous: To the Winds they set Thir corners, when with bluster to confound Sea, Aire, and Shoar, the Thunder when to rowle With terror through the dark Aereal Hall. Some say he bid his Angels turne ascanse The Poles of Earth twice ten degrees and more From the Suns Axle; they with labour push&amp;#39;d Oblique the Centric Globe: Som say the Sun Was bid turn Reines from th&amp;#39; Equinoctial Rode Like distant breadth to Taurus with the Seav&amp;#39;n Atlantick Sisters, and the Spartan Twins Up to the Tropic Crab; thence down amaine By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales, As deep as Capricorne, to bring in change Of Seasons to each Clime; else had the Spring Perpetual smil&amp;#39;d on Earth with vernant Flours, Equal in Days and Nights, except to those Beyond the Polar Circles; to them Day Had unbenighted shon, while the low Sun To recompence his distance, in thir sight Had rounded still th&amp;#39; Horizon, and not known Or East or West, which had forbid the Snow From cold Estotiland, and South as farr Beneath Magellan. At that tasted Fruit The Sun, as from Thyestean Banquet, turn&amp;#39;d His course intended; else how had the World Inhabited, though sinless, more then now, Avoided pinching cold and scorching heate? These changes in the Heav&amp;#39;ns, though slow, produc&amp;#39;d Like change on Sea and Land, sideral blast, Vapour, and Mist, and Exhalation hot, Corrupt and Pestilent: Now from the North Of Norumbega, and the Samoed shoar Bursting thir brazen Dungeon, armd with ice And snow and haile and stormie gust and flaw, Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud And Thrascias rend the Woods and Seas upturn; With adverse blast upturns them from the South Notus and Afer black with thundrous Clouds From Serraliona; thwart of these as fierce Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent Windes Eurus and Zephir with thir lateral noise, Sirocco, and Libecchio, Thus began Outrage from liveless things; but Discord first Daughter of Sin, among th&amp;#39; irrational, Death introduc&amp;#39;d through fierce antipathie: Beast now with Beast gan war, and Fowle with Fowle, And Fish with Fish; to graze the Herb all leaving, Devourd each other; nor stood much in awe Of Man, but fled him, or with count&amp;#39;nance grim Glar&amp;#39;d on him passing: these were from without The growing miseries, which Adam saw Alreadie in part, though hid in gloomiest shade, To sorrow abandond, but worse felt within, And in a troubl&amp;#39;d Sea of passion tost, Thus to disburd&amp;#39;n sought with sad complaint. O miserable of happie! is this the end Of this new glorious World, and mee so late The Glory of that Glory, who now becom Accurst of blessed, hide me from the face Of God, whom to behold was then my highth Of happiness: yet well, if here would end The miserie, I deserv&amp;#39;d it, and would beare My own deservings; but this will not serve; All that I eat or drink, or shall beget, Is propagated curse. O voice once heard Delightfully, Encrease and multiply, Now death to heare! for what can I encrease Or multiplie, but curses on my head? Who of all Ages to succeed, but feeling The evil on him brought by me, will curse My Head, Ill fare our Ancestor impure, For this we may thank Adam; but his thanks Shall be the execration; so besides Mine own that bide upon me, all from mee Shall with a fierce reflux on mee redound, On mee as on thir natural center light Heavie, though in thir place. O fleeting joyes Of Paradise, deare bought with lasting woes! Did I request thee, Maker, from my Clay To mould me Man, did I sollicite thee From darkness to promote me, or here place In this delicious Garden? as my Will Concurd not to my being, it were but right And equal to reduce me to my dust, Desirous to resigne, and render back All I receav&amp;#39;d, unable to performe Thy terms too hard, by which I was to hold The good I sought not. To the loss of that, Sufficient penaltie, why hast thou added The sense of endless woes? inexplicable Thy justice seems; yet to say truth, too late, I thus contest; then should have been refusd Those terms whatever, when they were propos&amp;#39;d: Thou didst accept them; wilt thou enjoy the good, Then cavil the conditions? and though God Made thee without thy leave, what if thy Son Prove disobedient, and reprov&amp;#39;d, retort, Wherefore didst thou beget me? I sought it not: Wouldst thou admit for his contempt of thee That proud excuse? yet him not thy election, But Natural necessity begot. God made thee of choice his own, and of his own To serve him, thy reward was of his grace, Thy punishment then justly is at his Will. Be it so, for I submit, his doom is fair, That dust I am, and shall to dust returne: O welcom hour whenever! why delayes His hand to execute what his Decree Fixd on this day? why do I overlive, Why am I mockt with death, and length&amp;#39;nd out To deathless pain? how gladly would I meet Mortalitie my sentence, and be Earth Insensible, how glad would lay me down As in my Mothers lap? there I should rest And sleep secure; his dreadful voice no more Would Thunder in my ears, no fear of worse To mee and to my ofspring would torment me With cruel expectation. Yet one doubt Pursues me still, least all I cannot die, Least that pure breath of Life, the Spirit of Man Which God inspir&amp;#39;d, cannot together perish With this corporeal Clod; then in the Grave, Or in some other dismal place who knows But I shall die a living Death? O thought Horrid, if true! yet why? it was but breath Of Life that sinn&amp;#39;d; what dies but what had life And sin? the Bodie properly hath neither. All of me then shall die: let this appease The doubt, since humane reach no further knows. For though the Lord of all be infinite, Is his wrauth also? be it, man is not so, But mortal doom&amp;#39;d. How can he exercise Wrath without end on Man whom Death must end? Can he make deathless Death? that were to make Strange contradiction, which to God himself Impossible is held, as Argument Of weakness, not of Power. Will he, draw out, For angers sake, finite to infinite In punisht man, to satisfie his rigour Satisfi&amp;#39;d never; that were to extend His Sentence beyond dust and Natures Law, By which all Causes else according still To the reception of thir matter act, Not to th&amp;#39; extent of thir own Spheare. But say That Death be not one stroak, as I suppos&amp;#39;d, Bereaving sense, but endless miserie From this day onward, which 1 feel begun Both in me, and without me, and so last To perpetuitie; Ay me, that fear Comes thundring back with dreadful revolution On my defensless head; both Death and I Am found Eternal, and incorporate both, Nor I on my part single, in mee all Posteritie stands curst: Fair Patrimonie That I must leave ye, Sons; O were I able To waste it all my self, and leave ye none! So disinherited how would ye bless Me now your curse! Ah, why should all mankind For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemn&amp;#39;d, If guiltless? But from me what can proceed, But all corrupt, both Mind and Will deprav&amp;#39;d, Not to do onely, but to will the same With me? how can they then acquitted stand In sight of God? Him after all Disputes Forc&amp;#39;t I absolve: all my evasions vain, And reasonings, though through Mazes, lead me still But to my own conviction: first and last On mee, mee onely, as the sourse and spring Of all corruption, all the blame lights due; So might the wrauth. Fond wish! couldst thou support That burden heavier then the Earth to bear Then all the World much heavier, though divided With that bad Woman? Thus what thou desir&amp;#39;st And what thou fearst, alike destroyes all hope Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable Beyond all past example and future, To Satan only like both crime and doom. O Conscience, into what Abyss of fears And horrors hast thou driv&amp;#39;n me; out of which I find no way, from deep to deeper plung&amp;#39;d! Thus Adam to himself lamented loud Through the still Night, not now, as ere man fell, Wholsom and cool, and mild, but with black Air Accompanied, with damps and dreadful gloom, Which to his evil Conscience represented All things with double terror: On the Ground Outstretcht he lay, on the cold ground, and oft Curs&amp;#39;d his Creation, Death as oft accus&amp;#39;d Of tardie execution, since denounc&amp;#39;t The day of his offence. Why comes not Death, Said hee, with one thrice acceptable stroke To end me? Shall Truth fail to keep her word, Justice Divine not hast&amp;#39;n to be just? But Death comes not at call, Justice Divine Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries. O Woods, O Fountains, Hillocks, Dales and Bowrs, With other echo late I taught your Shades To answer, and resound farr other Song. Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve bebeld, Desolate where she sate, approaching nigh, Soft words to his fierce passion she assay&amp;#39;d: But her with stern regard he thus repell&amp;#39;d. Out of my sight, thou Serpent, that name best Befits thee with him leagu&amp;#39;d, thy self as false And hateful; nothing wants, but that thy shape, Like his, and colour Serpentine may shew Thy inward fraud, to warn all Creatures from thee Henceforth; least that too heav&amp;#39;nly form, pretended To hellish falshood, snare them. But for thee I had persisted happie, had not thy pride And wandring vanitie, when lest was safe, Rejected my forewarning, and disdain&amp;#39;d Not to be trusted, longing to be seen Though by the Devil himself, him overweening To over-reach, but with the Serpent meeting Fool&amp;#39;d and beguil&amp;#39;d, by him thou, I by thee, To trust thee from my side, imagin&amp;#39;d wise, Constant, mature, proof against all assaults, And understood not all was but a shew Rather then solid vertu, all but a Rib Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears, More to the part sinister from me drawn, Well if thrown out, as supernumerarie To my just number found. O why did God, Creator wise, that peopl&amp;#39;d highest Heav&amp;#39;n With Spirits Masculine, create at last This noveltie on Earth, this fair defect Of Nature, and not fill the World at once With Men as Angels without Feminine, Or find some other way to generate Mankind? this mischief had not then befall&amp;#39;n, And more that shall befall, innumerable Disturbances on Earth through Femal snares, And straight conjunction with this Sex: for either He never shall find out fit Mate, but such As some misfortune brings him, or mistake, Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain Through her perversness, but shall see her gaind By a farr worse, or if she love, withheld By Parents, or his happiest choice too late Shall meet, alreadie linkt and Wedlock-bound To a fell Adversarie, his hate or shame: Which infinite calamitie shall cause To Humane life, and houshold peace confound. He added not, and from her turn&amp;#39;d, but Eve Not so repulst, with Tears that ceas&amp;#39;d not flowing, And tresses all disorderd, at his feet Fell humble, and imbracing them, besaught His peace, and thus proceeded in her plaint. Forsake me not thus, Adam, witness Heav&amp;#39;n What love sincere, and reverence in my heart I beare thee, and unweeting have offended, Unhappilie deceav&amp;#39;d; thy suppliant I beg, and clasp thy knees; bereave me not, Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid, Thy counsel in this uttermost distress, My onely strength and stay: forlorn of thee, Whither shall I betake me, where subsist? While yet we live, scarse one short hour perhaps, Between us two let there be peace, both joyning, As joyn&amp;#39;d in injuries, one enmitie Against a Foe by doom express assign&amp;#39;d us, That cruel Serpent: On me exercise not Thy hatred for this miserie befall&amp;#39;n, On me alreadie lost, mee then thy self More miserable; both have sin&amp;#39;d, but thou Against God onely, I against God and thee, And to the place of judgment will return, There with my cries importune Heaven, that all The sentence from thy head remov&amp;#39;d may light On me, sole cause to thee of all this woe, Mee mee onely just object of his ire. She ended weeping, and her lowlie plight, Immoveable till peace obtain&amp;#39;d from fault Acknowledg&amp;#39;d and deplor&amp;#39;d, in Adam wraught Commiseration; soon his heart relented Towards her, his life so late and sole delight, Now at his feet submissive in distress, Creature so faire his reconcilement seeking, His counsel whom she had displeas&amp;#39;d, his aide; As one disarm&amp;#39;d, his anger all he lost, And thus with peaceful words uprais&amp;#39;d her soon. Unwarie, and too desirous, as before, So now of what thou knowst not, who desir&amp;#39;st The punishment all on thy self; alas, Beare thine own first, ill able to sustaine His full wrauth whose thou feelst as yet lest part, And my displeasure bearst so ill. If Prayers Could alter high Decrees, I to that place Would speed before thee, and be louder heard, That on my head all might be visited, Thy frailtie and infirmer Sex forgiv&amp;#39;n, To me committed and by me expos&amp;#39;d. But rise, let us no more contend, nor blame Each other, blam&amp;#39;d enough elsewhere, but strive In offices of Love, how we may light&amp;#39;n Each others burden in our share of woe; Since this days Death denounc&amp;#39;t, if ought I see, Will prove no sudden, but a slow-pac&amp;#39;t evill, A long days dying to augment our paine, And to our Seed (O hapless Seed!) deriv&amp;#39;d. To whom thus Eve, recovering heart, repli&amp;#39;d. Adam, by sad experiment I know How little weight my words with thee can finde, Found so erroneous, thence by just event Found so unfortunate; nevertheless, Restor&amp;#39;d by thee, vile as I am, to place Of new acceptance, hopeful to regaine Thy Love, the sole contentment of my heart Living or dying, from thee I will not hide What thoughts in my unquiet brest are ris&amp;#39;n, Tending to some relief of our extremes, Or end, though sharp and sad, yet tolerable, As in our evils, and of easier choice. If care of our descent perplex us most, Which must be born to certain woe, devourd By Death at last, and miserable it is To be to others cause of misery, Our own begotten, and of our Loines to bring Into this cursed World a woful Race, That after wretched Life must be at last Food for so foule a Monster, in thy power It lies, yet ere Conception to prevent The Race unblest, to being yet unbegot. Childless thou art, Childless remaine: so Death Shall be deceav&amp;#39;d his glut, and with us two Be forc&amp;#39;d to satisfie his Rav&amp;#39;nous Maw. But if thou judge it hard and difficult, Conversing, looking, loving, to abstain From Loves due Rites, Nuptial imbraces sweet, And with desire to languish without hope, Before the present object languishing With like desire, which would be meserie And torment less then none of what we dread, Then both our selves and Seed at once to free From what we fear for both, let us make short, Let us seek Death, or he not found, supply With our own hands his Office on our selves; Why stand we longer shivering under feares, That shew no end but Death, and have the power, Of many ways to die the shortest choosing, Destruction with destruction to destroy. She ended heer, or vehement despaire Broke off the rest; so much of Death her thoughts Had entertaind, as di&amp;#39;d her Cheeks with pale. But Adam with such counsel nothing sway&amp;#39;d, To better hopes his more attentive minde Labouring had rais&amp;#39;d, and thus to Eve repli&amp;#39;d. Eve, thy contempt of life and pleasure seems To argue in thee somthing more sublime And excellent then what thy minde contemnes; But self-destruction therefore saught, refutes That excellence thought in thee, and implies, Not thy contempt, but anguish and regret For loss of life and pleasure overlov&amp;#39;d. Or if thou covet death, as utmost end Of miserie, so thinking to evade The penaltie pronounc&amp;#39;t, doubt not but God Hath wiselier arm&amp;#39;d his vengeful ire then so To be forestall&amp;#39;d; much more I fear least Death So snatcht will not exempt us from the paine We are by doom to pay; rather such acts Of contumacie will provoke the highest To make death in us live: Then let us seek Some safer resolution, which methinks I have in view, calling to minde with heed Part of our Sentence, that thy Seed shall bruise The Serpents head; piteous amends, unless Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand Foe Satan, who in the Serpent hath contriv&amp;#39;d Against us this deceit: to crush his head Would be revenge indeed; which will be lost By death brought on our selves, or childless days Resolv&amp;#39;d, as thou proposest; so our Foe Shall scape his punishment ordain&amp;#39;d, and wee Instead shall double ours upon our heads. No more be mention&amp;#39;d then of violence Against our selves, and wilful barrenness, That cuts us off from hope, and savours onely Rancor and pride, impatience and despite, Reluctance against God and his just yoke Laid on our Necks. Remember with what mild And gracious temper he both heard and judg&amp;#39;d Without wrauth or reviling; wee expected Immediate dissolution, which we thought Was meant by Death that day, when lo, to thee Pains onely in Child-bearing were foretold, And bringing forth, soon recompenc&amp;#39;t with joy, Fruit of thy Womb: On mee the Curse aslope Glanc&amp;#39;d on the ground, with labour I must earne My bread; what harm? Idleness had bin worse; My labour will sustain me; and least Cold Or Heat should injure us, his timely care Hath unbesaught provided, and his hands Cloath&amp;#39;d us unworthie, pitying while he judg&amp;#39;d; How much more, if we pray him, will his ear Be open, and his heart to pitie incline, And teach us further by what means to shun Th&amp;#39; inclement Seasons, Rain, Ice, Hail and Snow, Which now the Skie with various Face begins To shew us in this Mountain, while the Winds Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks Of these fair spreading Trees; which bids us seek Som better shroud, som better warmth to cherish Our Limbs benumm&amp;#39;d, ere this diurnal Starr Leave cold the Night, how we his gather&amp;#39;d beams Reflected, may with matter sere foment, Or by collision of two bodies grinde The Air attrite to Fire, as late the Clouds Justling or pusht with Winds rude in thir shock Tine the slant Lightning, whose thwart flame driv&amp;#39;n down Kindles the gummie bark of Firr or Pine, And sends a comfortable heat from farr, Which might supplie the Sun: such Fire to use, And what may else be remedie or cure To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought, Hee will instruct us praying, and of Grace Beseeching him, so as we need not fear To pass commodiously this life, sustain&amp;#39;d By him with many comforts, till we end In dust, our final rest and native home. What better can we do, then to the place Repairing where he judg&amp;#39;d us, prostrate fall Before him reverent, and there confess Humbly our faults, and pardon beg, with tears Watering the ground, and with our sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign&amp;#39;d, and humiliation meek. Undoubtedly he will relent and turn From his displeasure; in whose look serene, When angry most he seem&amp;#39;d and most severe, What else but favor, grace, and mercie shon? So spake our Father penitent, nor Eve Felt less remorse: they forthwith to the place Repairing where he judg&amp;#39;d them prostrate fell Before him reverent, and both confess&amp;#39;d Humbly thir faults, and pardon beg&amp;#39;d, with tears Watering the ground, and with thir sighs the Air Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign Of sorrow unfeign&amp;#39;d, and humiliation meek.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;THus they in lowliest plight repentant stood Praying, for from the Mercie-seat above Prevenient Grace descending had remov&amp;#39;d The stonie from thir hearts, &amp;amp; made new flesh Regenerate grow instead, that sighs now breath&amp;#39;d Unutterable, which the Spirit of prayer Inspir&amp;#39;d, and wing&amp;#39;d for Heav&amp;#39;n with speedier flight Then loudest Oratorie: yet thir port Not of mean suiters, nor important less Seem&amp;#39;d thir Petition, then when th&amp;#39; ancient Pair In Fables old, less ancient yet then these, Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore The Race of Mankind drownd, before the Shrine Of Themis stood devout. To Heav&amp;#39;n thir prayers Flew up, nor missd the way, by envious windes Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passd Dimentionless through Heav&amp;#39;nly dores; then clad With incense, where the Golden Altar fum&amp;#39;d, By thir great Intercessor, came in sight Before the Fathers Throne: Them the glad Son Presenting, thus to intercede began. See Father, what first fruits on Earth are sprung From thy implanted Grace in Man, these Sighs And Prayers, which in this Golden Censer, mixt With Incense, I thy Priest before thee bring, Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed Sow&amp;#39;n with contrition in his heart, then those Which his own hand manuring all the Trees Of Paradise could have produc&amp;#39;t, ere fall&amp;#39;n From innocence. Now therefore bend thine eare To supplication, heare his sighs though mute; Unskilful with what words to pray, Iet mee Interpret for him, mee his Advocate And propitiation, all his works on mee Good or not good ingraft, my Merit those Shall perfet, and for these my Death shall pay. Accept me, and in mee from these receave The smell of peace toward Mankinde, let him live Before thee reconcil&amp;#39;d, at least his days Numberd, though sad, till Death, his doom (which I To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse) To better life shall yeeld him, where with mee All my redeemd may dwell in joy and bliss, Made one with me as I with thee am one. To whom the Father, without Cloud, serene. All thy request for Man, accepted Son, Obtain, all thy request was my Decree: But longer in that Paradise to dwell, The Law I gave to Nature him forbids: Those pure immortal Elements that know No gross, no unharmoneous mixture foule, Eject him tainted now, and purge him off As a distemper, gross to aire as gross, And mortal food, as may dispose him best For dissolution wrought by Sin, that first Distemperd all things, and of incorrupt Corrupted. I at first with two fair gifts Created him endowd, with Happiness And Immortalitie: that fondly lost, This other serv&amp;#39;d but to eternize woe; Till I provided Death; so Death becomes His final remedie, and after Life Tri&amp;#39;d in sharp tribulation, and refin&amp;#39;d By Faith and faithful works, to second Life, Wak&amp;#39;t in the renovation of the just, Resignes him up with Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth renewd. But let us call to Synod all the Blest Through Heav&amp;#39;ns wide bounds; from them I will not hide My judgments, how with Mankind I proceed, As how with peccant Angels late they saw; And in thir state, though firm, stood more confirmd. He ended, and the Son gave signal high To the bright Minister that watchd, hee blew His Trumpet, heard in Oreb since perhaps When God descended, and perhaps once more To sound at general Doom. Th&amp;#39; Angelic blast Filld all the Regions: from thir blissful Bowrs Of Amarantin Shade, Fountain or Spring, By the waters of Life, where ere they sate In fellowships of joy: the Sons of Light Hasted, resorting to the Summons high, And took thir Seats; till from his Throne supream Th&amp;#39; Almighty thus pronouncd his sovran Will. O Sons, like one of us Man is become To know both Good and Evil, since his taste Of that defended Fruit; but let him boast His knowledge of Good lost, and Evil got, Happier, had it suffic&amp;#39;d him to have known Good by it self, and Evil not at all. He sorrows now, repents, and prayes contrite, My motions in him, longer then they move, His heart I know, how variable and vain Self-left. Least therefore his now bolder hand Reach also of the Tree of Life, and eat, And live for ever, dream at least to live For ever, to remove him I decree, And send him from the Garden forth to Till The Ground whence he was taken, fitter soile. Michael, this my behest have thou in charge, Take to thee from among the Cherubim Thy choice of flaming Warriours, least the Fiend Or in behalf of Man, or to invade Vacant possession som new trouble raise: Hast thee, and from the Paradise of God Without remorse drive out the sinful Pair, From hallowd ground th&amp;#39; unholie, and denounce To them and to thir Progenie from thence Perpetual banishment. Yet least they faint At the sad Sentence rigorously urg&amp;#39;d, For I behold them softn&amp;#39;d and with tears Bewailing thir excess, all terror hide. If patiently thy bidding they obey, Dismiss them not disconsolate; reveale To Adam what shall come in future dayes, As I shall thee enlighten, intermix My Cov&amp;#39;nant in the womans seed renewd; So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace: And on the East side of the Garden place, Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbes, Cherubic watch, and of a Sword the flame Wide waving, all approach farr off to fright, And guard all passage to the Tree of Life: Least Paradise a receptacle prove To Spirits foule, and all my Trees thir prey, With whose stol&amp;#39;n Fruit Man once more to delude. He ceas&amp;#39;d; and th&amp;#39; Archangelic Power prepar&amp;#39;d For swift descent, with him the Cohort bright Of watchful Cherubim; four faces each Had, like a double Janus, all thir shape Spangl&amp;#39;d with eyes more numerous then those Of Argus, and more wakeful then to drouze, Charm&amp;#39;d with Arcadian Pipe, the Pastoral Reed Of Hermes, or his opiate Rod. Mean while To resalute the World with sacred Light Leucothea wak&amp;#39;d, and with fresh dews imbalmd The Earth, when Adam and first Matron Eve Had ended now thir Orisons, and found Strength added from above, new hope to spring Out of despaire, joy, but with fear yet linkt; Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewd. Eve, easily may Faith admit, that all The good which we enjoy, from Heav&amp;#39;n descends; But that from us ought should ascend to Heav&amp;#39;n So prevalent as to concerne the mind Of God high-blest, or to incline his will, Hard to belief may seem; yet this will Prayer, Or one short sigh of humane breath, up-borne Ev&amp;#39;n to the Seat of God. For since I saught By Prayer th&amp;#39; offended Deitie to appease, Kneel&amp;#39;d and before him humbl&amp;#39;d all my heart, Methought I saw him placable and mild, Bending his eare; perswasion in me grew That I was heard with favour; peace returnd Home to my Brest, and to my memorie His promise, that thy Seed shall bruise our Foe; Which then not minded in dismay, yet now Assures me that the bitterness of death Is past, and we shall live. Whence Haile to thee, Eve rightly call&amp;#39;d, Mother of all Mankind, Mother of all things living, since by thee Man is to live, and all things live for Man. To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek. Ill worthie I such title should belong To me transgressour, who for thee ordaind A help, became thy snare; to mee reproach Rather belongs, distrust and all dispraise: But infinite in pardon was my Judge, That I who first brought Death on all, am grac&amp;#39;t The sourse of life; next favourable thou, Who highly thus to entitle me voutsaf&amp;#39;st, Farr other name deserving. But the Field To labour calls us now with sweat impos&amp;#39;d, Though after sleepless Night; for see the Morn, All unconcern&amp;#39;d with our unrest, begins Her rosie progress smiling; let us forth, I never from thy side henceforth to stray, Wherere our days work lies, though now enjoind Laborious, till day droop; while here we dwell, What can be toilsom in these pleasant Walkes? Here let us live, though in fall&amp;#39;n state, content. So spake, so wish&amp;#39;d much-humbl&amp;#39;d Eve, but Fate Subscrib&amp;#39;d not; Nature first gave Signs, imprest On Bird, Beast, Aire, Aire suddenly eclips&amp;#39;d After short blush of Morn; nigh in her sight The Bird of Jove, stoopt from his aerie tour, Two Birds of gayest plume before him drove: Down from a Hill the Beast that reigns in Woods, First hunter then, pursu&amp;#39;d a gentle brace, Goodliest of all the Forrest, Hart and Hinde; Direct to th&amp;#39; Eastern Gate was bent thir flight. Adam observ&amp;#39;d, and with his Eye the chase Pursuing, not unmov&amp;#39;d to Eve thus spake. O Eve, some furder change awaits us nigh, Which Heav&amp;#39;n by these mute signs in Nature shews Forerunners of his purpose, or to warn Us haply too secure of our discharge From penaltie, because from death releast Some days; how long, and what till then our life, Who knows, or more then this, that we are dust, And thither must return and be no more. Why else this double object in our fight Of flight pursu&amp;#39;d in th&amp;#39; Air and ore the ground One way the self-same hour? why in the East Darkness ere Dayes mid-course, and Morning light More orient in yon Western Cloud that draws O&amp;#39;re the blew Firmament a radiant white, And slow descends, with somthing heav&amp;#39;nly fraught. He err&amp;#39;d not, for by this the heav&amp;#39;nly Bands Down from a Skie of Jasper lighted now In Paradise, and on a Hill made alt, A glorious Apparition, had not doubt And carnal fear that day dimm&amp;#39;d Adams eye. Not that more glorious, when the Angels met Jacob in Mahanaim, where he saw The field Pavilion&amp;#39;d with his Guardians bright; Nor that which on the flaming Mount appeerd In Dothan, cover&amp;#39;d with a Camp of Fire, Against the Syrian King, who to surprize One man, Assassin-like had levied Warr, Warr unproclam&amp;#39;d. The Princely Hierarch In thir bright stand, there left his Powers to seise Possession of the Garden; hee alone, To find where Adam shelterd, took his way, Not unperceav&amp;#39;d of Adam, who to Eve, While the great Visitant approachd, thus spake. Eve, now expect great tidings, which perhaps Of us will soon determin, or impose New Laws to be observ&amp;#39;d; for I descrie From yonder blazing Cloud that veils the Hill One of the heav&amp;#39;nly Host, and by his Gate None of the meanest, some great Potentate Or of the Thrones above, such Majestie Invests him coming; yet not terrible, That I should fear, nor sociably mild, As Raphael, that I should much confide, But solemn and sublime, whom not to offend, With reverence I must meet, and thou retire. He ended; and th&amp;#39; Arch-Angel soon drew nigh, Not in his shape Celestial, but as Man Clad to meet Man; over his lucid Armes A militarie Vest of purple flowd Livelier then Meliboean, or the graine Of Sarra, worn by Kings and Hero&amp;#39;s old In time of Truce; lris had dipt the wooff; His starrie Helme unbuckl&amp;#39;d shew&amp;#39;d him prime In Manhood where Youth ended; by his side As in a glistering Zodiac hung the Sword, Satans dire dread, and in his hand the Spear. Adam bowd low, hee Kingly from his State Inclin&amp;#39;d not, but his coming thus declar&amp;#39;d. Adam, Heav&amp;#39;ns high behest no Preface needs: Sufficient that thy Prayers are heard, and Death, Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress, Defeated of his seisure many dayes Giv&amp;#39;n thee of Grace, wherein thou may&amp;#39;st repent, And one bad act with many deeds well done Mayst cover: well may then thy Lord appeas&amp;#39;d Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claime; But longer in this Paradise to dwell Permits not; to remove thee I am come, And send thee from the Garden forth to till The ground whence thou wast tak&amp;#39;n, fitter Soile. He added not, for Adam at the newes Heart-strook with chilling gripe of sorrow stood, That all his senses bound; Eve, who unseen Yet all had heard, with audible lament Discover&amp;#39;d soon the place of her retire. O unexpected stroke, worse then of Death! Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave Thee Native Soile, these happie Walks and Shades, Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend, Quiet though sad, the respit of that day That must be mortal to us both. O flours, That never will in other Climate grow, My early visitation, and my last At Eev&amp;#39;n, which I bred up with tender hand From the first op&amp;#39;ning bud, and gave ye Names, Who now shall reare ye to the Sun, or ranke Your Tribes, and water from th&amp;#39; ambrosial Fount? Thee lastly nuptial Bowre, by mee adornd With what to sight or smell was sweet; from thee How shall I part, and whither wander down Into a lower World, to this obscure And wilde, how shall we breath in other Aire Less pure, accustomd to immortal Fruits? Whom thus the Angel interrupted milde. Lament not Eve, but patiently resigne What justly thou hast lost; nor set thy heart, Thus over-fond, on that which is not thine; Thy going is not lonely, with thee goes Thy Husband, him to follow thou art bound; Where he abides, think there thy native soile. Adam by this from the cold sudden damp Recovering, and his scatterd spirits returnd, To Michael thus his humble words addressd. Celestial, whether among the Thrones, or nam&amp;#39;d Of them the Highest, for such of shape may seem Prince above Princes, gently hast thou tould Thy message, which might else in telling wound, And in performing end us; what besides Of sorrow and dejection and despair Our frailtie can sustain, thy tidings bring, Departure from this happy place, our sweet Recess, and onely consolation left Familiar to our eyes, all places else Inhospitable appeer and desolate, Nor knowing us nor known: and if by prayer Incessant I could hope to change the will Of him who all things can, I would not cease To wearie him with my assiduous cries: But prayer against his absolute Decree No more availes then breath against the winde, Blown stifling back on him that breaths it forth: Therefore to his great bidding I submit. This most afflicts me, that departing hence, As from his face I shall be hid, deprivd His blessed count&amp;#39;nance; here I could frequent, With worship, place by place where he voutsaf&amp;#39;d Presence Divine, and to my Sons relate; On this Mount he appeerd, under this Tree Stood visible, among these Pines his voice I heard, here with him at this Fountain talk&amp;#39;d: So many grateful Altars I would reare Of grassie Terfe, and pile up every Stone Of lustre from the brook, in memorie, Or monument to Ages, and thereon Offer sweet smelling Gumms and Fruits and Flours: In yonder nether World where shall I seek His bright appearances, or foot-step trace? For though I fled him angrie, yet recall&amp;#39;d To life prolongd and promisd Race, I now Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts Of glory, and farr off his steps adore. To whom thus Michael with regard benigne. Adam, thou know&amp;#39;st Heav&amp;#39;n his, and all the Earth. Not this Rock onely; his Omnipresence fills Land, Sea, and Aire, and every kinde that lives, Fomented by his virtual power and warmd: All th&amp;#39; Earth he gave thee to possess and rule, No despicable gift; surmise not then His presence to these narrow bounds confin&amp;#39;d Of Paradise or Eden: this had been Perhaps thy Capital Seate, from whence had spred All generations, and had hither come From all the ends of th&amp;#39; Earth, to celebrate And reverence thee thir great Progenitor. But this praeeminence thou hast lost, brought down To dwell on eeven ground now with thy Sons: Yet doubt not but in Vallie and in plaine God is as here, and will be found alike Present, and of his presence many a signe Still following thee, still compassing thee round With goodness and paternal Love, his Face Express, and of his steps the track Divine. Which that thou mayst beleeve, and be confirmd Ere thou from hence depart, know I am sent To shew thee what shall come in future dayes To thee and to thy Ofspring; good with bad Expect to hear, supernal Grace contending With sinfulness of Men; thereby to learn True patience, and to temper joy with fear And pious sorrow, equally enur&amp;#39;d By moderation either state to beare, Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead Safest thy life, and best prepar&amp;#39;d endure Thy mortal passage when it comes. Ascend This Hill; let Eve (for I have drencht her eyes) Here sleep below while thou to foresight wak&amp;#39;st, As once thou slepst, while Shee to life was formd. To whom thus Adam gratefully repli&amp;#39;d. Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path Thou lead&amp;#39;st me, and to the hand of Heav&amp;#39;n submit, However chast&amp;#39;ning, to the evil turne My obvious breast, arming to overcom By suffering, and earne rest from labour won, If so I may attain. So both ascend In the Visions of God: It was a Hill Of Paradise the highest, from whose top The Hemisphere of Earth in cleerest Ken Stretcht out to the amplest reach of prospect lay. Not higher that Hill nor wider looking round, Whereon for different cause the Tempter set Our second Adam in the Wilderness, To shew him all Earths Kingdomes and thir Glory. His Eye might there command wherever stood City of old or modern Fame, the Seat Of mightiest Empire, from the destind Walls Of Cambalu, seat of Cathaian Can And Samarchand by Oxus, Temirs Throne, To Paquin of Sinaean Kings, and thence To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul Down to the golden Chersonese, or where The Persian in Ecbatan sate, or since In Hispahan, or where the Russian Ksar In Mosco, or the Sultan in Bizance, Turchestan-born; nor could his eye not ken Th&amp;#39; Empire of Negus to his utmost Port Ercoco and the less Maritim Kings Mombaza, and Quiloa, and Melind, And Sofala thought Ophir, to the Realme Of Congo, and Angola fardest South; Or thence from Niger Flood to Atlas Mount The Kingdoms of Almansor, Fez and Sus, Marocco and Algiers, and Tremisen; On Europe thence, and where Rome was to sway The World: in Spirit perhaps he also saw Rich Mexico the seat of Motezume, And Cusco in Peru, the richer seat Of Atabalipa, and yet unspoil&amp;#39;d Guiana, whose great Citie Geryons Sons Call El Dorado: but to nobler sights Michael from Adams eyes the Filme remov&amp;#39;d Which that false Fruit that promis&amp;#39;d clearer sight Had bred; then purg&amp;#39;d with Euphrasie and Rue The visual Nerve, for he had much to see; And from the Well of Life three drops instill&amp;#39;d. So deep the power of these Ingredients pierc&amp;#39;d, Eevn to the inmost seat of mental sight, That Adam now enforc&amp;#39;t to close his eyes, Sunk down and all his Spirits became intranst: But him the gentle Angel by the hand Soon rais&amp;#39;d, and his attention thus recall&amp;#39;d. Adam, now ope thine eyes, and first behold Th&amp;#39; effects which thy original crime hath wrought In some to spring from thee, who never touch&amp;#39;d Th&amp;#39; excepted Tree, nor with the Snake conspir&amp;#39;d, Nor sinn&amp;#39;d thy sin, yet from that sin derive Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds. His eyes he op&amp;#39;nd, and beheld a field, Part arable and tilth, whereon were Sheaves New reapt, the other part sheep-walks and foulds; Ith&amp;#39; midst an Altar as the Land-mark stood Rustic, of grassie sord; thither anon A sweatie Reaper from his Tillage brought First Fruits, the green Eare, and the yellow Sheaf, Uncull&amp;#39;d, as came to hand; a Shepherd next More meek came with the Firstlings of his Flock Choicest and best; then sacrificing, laid The Inwards and thir Fat, with Incense strew&amp;#39;d, On the cleft Wood, and all due Rites perform&amp;#39;d. His Offring soon propitious Fire from Heav&amp;#39;n Consum&amp;#39;d with nimble glance, and grateful steame; The others not, for his was not sincere; Whereat hee inlie rag&amp;#39;d, and as they talk&amp;#39;d, Smote him into the Midriff with a stone That beat out life; he fell, and deadly pale Groand out his Soul with gushing bloud effus&amp;#39;d. Much at that sight was Adam in his heart Dismai&amp;#39;d, and thus in haste to th&amp;#39; Angel cri&amp;#39;d. O Teacher, some great mischief hath befall&amp;#39;n To that meek man, who well had sacrific&amp;#39;d; Is Pietie thus and pure Devotion paid? T&amp;#39; whom Michael thus, hee also mov&amp;#39;d, repli&amp;#39;d. These two are Brethren, Adam, and to come Out of thy loyns; th&amp;#39; unjust the just hath slain, For envie that his Brothers Offering found From Heav&amp;#39;n acceptance; but the bloodie Fact Will be aveng&amp;#39;d, and th&amp;#39; others Faith approv&amp;#39;d Loose no reward, though here thou see him die, Rowling in dust and gore. To which our Sire. Alas, both for the deed and for the cause! But have I now seen Death? Is this the way I must return to native dust? O sight Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold, Horrid to think, how horrible to feel! To whom thus Michael. Death thou hast seen In his first shape on man; but many shapes Of Death, and many are the wayes that lead To his grim Cave, all dismal; yet to sense More terrible at th&amp;#39; entrance then within. Some, as thou saw&amp;#39;st, by violent stroke shall die, By Fire, Flood, Famin, by Intemperance more In Meats and Drinks which on the Earth shall bring Diseases dire, of which a monstrous crew Before thee shall appear; that thou mayst know What miserie th&amp;#39; inabstinence of Eve Shall bring on men. Immediately a place Before his eyes appeard, sad, noysom, dark, A Lazar-house it seemd, wherein were laid Numbers of all diseas&amp;#39;d, all maladies Of gastly Spasm, or racking torture, qualmes Of heart-sick Agonie, all feavorous kinds, Convulsions, Epilepsies, fierce Catarrhs, Intestin Stone and Ulcer, Colic pangs, Daemoniac Phrenzie, moaping Melancholie And Moon-struck madness, pining Atrophie, Marasmus, and wide-wasting Pestilence, Dropsies, and Asthma&amp;#39;s, and Joint-racking Rheums. Dire was the tossing, deep the groans, despair Tended the sick busiest from Couch to Couch; And over them triumphant Death his Dart Shook, but delaid to strike, though oft invok&amp;#39;t With vows, as thir chief good, and final hope. Sight so deform what heart of Rock could long Drie-ey&amp;#39;d behold? Adam could not, but wept, Though not of Woman born; compassion quell&amp;#39;d His best of Man, and gave him up to tears A space, till firmer thoughts restraind excess, And scarce recovering words his plaint renew&amp;#39;d. O miserable Mankind, to what fall Degraded, to what wretched state reserv&amp;#39;d! Better end heer unborn. Why is life giv&amp;#39;n To be thus wrested from us? rather why Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew What we receive, would either not accept Life offer&amp;#39;d, or soon beg to lay it down, Glad to be so dismist in peace. Can thus Th&amp;#39; Image of God in man created once So goodly and erect, though faultie since, To such unsightly sufferings be debas&amp;#39;t Under inhuman pains? Why should not Man, Retaining still Divine similitude In part, from such deformities be free, And for his Makers Image sake exempt? Thir Makers Image, answerd Michael, then Forsook them, when themselves they villifi&amp;#39;d To serve ungovern&amp;#39;d appetite, and took His Image whom they serv&amp;#39;d, a brutish vice, Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve. Therefore so abject is thir punishment, Disfiguring not Gods likeness, but thir own, Or if his likeness, by themselves defac&amp;#39;t While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules To loathsom sickness, worthily, since they Gods Image did not reverence in themselves. I yield it just, said Adam, and submit. But is there yet no other way, besides These painful passages, how we may come To Death, and mix with our connatural dust; There is, said Michael, if thou well observe The rule of not too much, by temperance taught In what thou eatst and drinkst, seeking from thence Due nourishment, not gluttonous delight, Till many years over thy head return: So maist thou live, till like ripe Fruit thou drop Into thy Mothers lap, or be with ease Gatherd, not harshly pluckt, for death mature: This is old age; but then thou must outlive Thy youth, thy strength, thy beauty, which will change To witherd weak and gray; thy Senses then Obtuse, all taste of pleasure must forgoe, To what thou hast, and for the Aire of youth Hopeful and cheerful, in thy blood will reigne A Melancholy damp of cold and dry To weigh thy Spirits down, and last consume The Balme of Life. To whom our Ancestor. Henceforth I flie not Death, nor would prolong Life much, bent rather how I may be quit Fairest and easiest of this combrous charge, Which I must keep till my appointed day Of rendring up, and patiently attend My dissolution. Michael repli&amp;#39;d. Nor love thy Life, nor hate; but what thou livst Live well, how long or short permit to Heav&amp;#39;n: And now prepare thee for another sight. He lookd and saw a spacious Plaine, whereon Were Tents of various hue; by some were herds Of Cattel grazing: others, whence the sound Of Instruments that made melodious chime Was heard, of Harp and Organ; and who moovd Thir stops and chords was seen: his volant touch Instinct through all proportions low and high Fled and pursu&amp;#39;d transverse the resonant fugue. In other part stood one who at the Forge Labouring, two massie clods of Iron and Brass Had melted (whether found where casual fire Had wasted woods on Mountain or in Vale, Down to the veins of Earth, thence gliding hot To som Caves mouth, or whether washt by stream From underground) the liquid Ore he dreind Into fit moulds prepar&amp;#39;d; from which he formd First his own Tooles; then, what might else be wrought Fusil or grav&amp;#39;n in mettle. After these, But on the hether side a different sort From the high neighbouring Hills, which was thir Seat, Down to the Plain descended: by thir guise Just men they seemd, and all thir study bent To worship God aright, and know his works Not hid, nor those things last which might preserve Freedom and Peace to men: they on the Plain Long had not walkt, when from the Tents behold A Beavie of fair Women, richly gay In Gems and wanton dress; to the Harp they sung Soft amorous Ditties, and in dance came on: The Men though grave, ey&amp;#39;d them, and let thir eyes Rove without rein, till in the amorous Net Fast caught, they lik&amp;#39;d, and each his liking chose; And now of love they treat till th&amp;#39; Eevning Star Loves Harbinger appeerd; then all in heat They light the Nuptial Torch, and bid invoke Hymen, then first to marriage Rites invok&amp;#39;t; With Feast and Musick all the Tents resound. Such happy interview and fair event Of love and youth not lost, Songs, Garlands, Flours, And charming Symphonies attach&amp;#39;d the heart Of Adam, soon enclin&amp;#39;d to admit delight, The bent of Nature; which he thus express&amp;#39;d. True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest, Much better seems this Vision, and more hope Of peaceful dayes portends, then those two past; Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse, Here Nature seems fulfilld in all her ends. To whom thus Michael. Judg not what is best By pleasure, though to Nature seeming meet, Created, as thou art, to nobler end Holie and pure, conformitie divine. Those Tents thou sawst so pleasant, were the Tents Of wickedness, wherein shall dwell his Race Who slew his Brother; studious they appere Of Arts that polish Life, Inventers rare, Unmindful of thir Maker, though his Spirit Taught them, but they his gifts acknowledg&amp;#39;d none. Yet they a beauteous ofspring shall beget; For that fair femal Troop thou sawst, that seemd Of Goddesses, so blithe, so smooth, so gay, Yet empty of all good wherein consists Womans domestic honour and chief praise; Bred onely and completed to the taste Of lustful appetence, to sing, to dance, To dress, and troule the Tongue, and roule the Eye. To these that sober Race of Men, whose lives Religious titl&amp;#39;d them the Sons of God, Shall yield up all thir vertue, all thir fame Ignobly, to the traines and to the smiles Of these fair Atheists, and now swim in joy, (Erelong to swim at large) and laugh; for which The world erelong a world of tears must weepe. To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft. O pittie and shame, that they who to live well Enterd so faire, should turn aside to tread Paths indirect, or in the mid way faint! But still I see the tenor of Mans woe Holds on the same, from Woman to begin. From Mans effeminate slackness it begins, Said th&amp;#39; Angel, who should better hold his place By wisdome, and superiour gifts receav&amp;#39;d. But now prepare thee for another Scene. He lookd and saw wide Territorie spred Before him, Towns, and rural works between, Cities of Men with lofty Gates and Towrs, Concours in Arms, fierce Faces threatning Warr, Giants of mightie Bone, and bould emprise; Part wield thir Arms, part courb the foaming Steed, Single or in Array of Battel rang&amp;#39;d Both Horse and Foot, nor idely mustring stood; One way a Band select from forage drives A herd of Beeves, faire Oxen and faire Kine From a fat Meddow ground; or fleecy Flock, Ewes and thir bleating Lambs over the Plaine, Thir Bootie; scarce with Life the Shepherds flye, But call in aide, which makes a bloody Fray; With cruel Tournament the Squadrons joine; Where Cattle pastur&amp;#39;d late, now scatterd lies With Carcasses and Arms th&amp;#39; ensanguind Field Deserted: Others to a Citie strong Lay Seige, encampt; by Batterie, Scale, and Mine, Assaulting; others from the wall defend With Dart and Jav&amp;#39;lin, Stones and sulfurous Fire; On each hand slaughter and gigantic deeds. In other part the scepter&amp;#39;d Haralds call To Council in the Citie Gates: anon Grey-headed men and grave, with Warriours mixt, Assemble, and Harangues are heard, but soon In factious opposition, till at last Of middle Age one rising, eminent In wise deport, spake much of Right and Wrong, Of Justice, of Religion, Truth and Peace, And Judgment from above: him old and young Exploded and had seiz&amp;#39;d with violent hands, Had not a Cloud descending snatch&amp;#39;d him thence Unseen amid the throng: so violence Proceeded, and Oppression, and Sword-Law Through all the Plain, and refuge none was found. Adam was all in tears, and to his guide Lamenting turnd full sad; O what are these, Deaths Ministers, not Men, who thus deal Death Inhumanly to men, and multiply Ten thousandfould the sin of him who slew His Brother; for of whom such massacher Make they but of thir Brethren, men of men? But who was that Just Man, whom had not Heav&amp;#39;n Rescu&amp;#39;d, had in his Righteousness bin lost? To whom thus Michael. These are the product Of those ill mated Marriages thou saw&amp;#39;st; Where good with bad were matcht, who of themselves Abhor to joyn; and by imprudence mixt, Produce prodigious Births of bodie or mind. Such were these Giants, men of high renown; For in those dayes Might onely shall be admir&amp;#39;d, And Valour and Heroic Vertu call&amp;#39;d; To overcome in Battle, and subdue Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite Man-slaughter, shall be held the highest pitch Of human Glorie, and for Glorie done Of triumph, to be styl&amp;#39;d great Conquerours, Patrons of Mankind, Gods, and Sons of Gods, Destroyers rightlier call&amp;#39;d and Plagues of men. Thus Fame shall be atchiev&amp;#39;d, renown on Earth, And what most merits fame in silence hid. But hee the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst The onely righteous in a World perverse, And therefore hated, therefore so beset With Foes for daring single to be just, And utter odious Truth, that God would come To judge them with his Saints: Him the most High Rapt in a balmie Cloud with winged Steeds Did, as thou sawst, receave, to walk with God High in Salvation and the Climes of bliss, Exempt from Death; to shew thee what reward Awaits the good, the rest what punishment; Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold. He look&amp;#39;d, and saw the face of things quite chang&amp;#39;d, The brazen Throat of Warr had ceast to roar, All now was turn&amp;#39;d to jollitie and game, To luxurie and riot, feast and dance, Marrying or prostituting, as befell, Rape or Adulterie, where passing faire Allurd them; thence from Cups to civil Broiles. At length a Reverend Sire among them came, And of thir doings great dislike declar&amp;#39;d, And testifi&amp;#39;d against thir wayes; hee oft Frequented thir Assemblies, whereso met, Triumphs or Festivals, and to them preachd Conversion and Repentance, as to Souls In Prison under Judgements imminent: But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceas&amp;#39;d Contending, and remov&amp;#39;d his Tents farr off; Then from the Mountain hewing Timber tall, Began to build a Vessel of huge bulk, Measur&amp;#39;d by Cubit, length, and breadth, and highth, Smeard round with Pitch, and in the side a dore Contriv&amp;#39;d, and of provisions laid in large For Man and Beast: when loe a wonder strange! Of every Beast, and Bird, and Insect small Came seavens, and pairs, and enterd in, as taught Thir order: last the Sire, and his three Sons With thir four Wives; and God made fast the dore. Meanwhile the Southwind rose, and with black wings Wide hovering, all the Clouds together drove From under Heav&amp;#39;n; the Hills to their supplie Vapour, and Exhalation dusk and moist, Sent up amain; and now the thick&amp;#39;nd Skie Like a dark Ceeling stood; down rush&amp;#39;d the Rain Impetuous, and continu&amp;#39;d till the Earth No more was seen; the floating Vessel swum Uplifted; and secure with beaked prow Rode tilting o&amp;#39;re the Waves, all dwellings else Flood overwhelmd, and them with all thir pomp Deep under water rould; Sea cover&amp;#39;d Sea, Sea without shoar; and in thir Palaces Where luxurie late reign&amp;#39;d, Sea-monsters whelp&amp;#39;d And stabl&amp;#39;d; of Mankind, so numerous late, All left, in one small bottom swum imbark&amp;#39;t. How didst thou grieve then, Adam, to behold The end of all thy Ofspring, end so sad, Depopulation; thee another Floud, Of tears and sorrow a Floud thee also drown&amp;#39;d, And sunk thee as thy Sons; till gently reard By th&amp;#39; Angel, on thy feet thou stoodst at last, Though comfortless, as when a Father mourns His Children, all in view destroyd at once; And scarce to th&amp;#39; Angel utterdst thus thy plaint. O Visions ill foreseen! better had I Liv&amp;#39;d ignorant of future, so had borne My part of evil onely, each dayes lot Anough to beare; those now, that were dispenst The burd&amp;#39;n of many Ages, on me light At once, by my foreknowledge gaining Birth Abortive, to torment me ere thir being, With thought that they must be. Let no man seek Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall Him or his Childern, evil he may be sure, Which neither his foreknowing can prevent, And hee the future evil shall no less In apprehension then in substance feel Grievous to bear: but that care now is past, Man is not whom to warne: those few escap&amp;#39;t Famin and anguish will at last consume Wandring that watrie Desert: I had hope When violence was ceas&amp;#39;t, and Warr on Earth, All would have then gon well, peace would have crownd With length of happy dayes the race of man; But I was farr deceav&amp;#39;d; for now I see Peace to corrupt no less then Warr to waste. How comes it thus? unfould, Celestial Guide, And whether here the Race of man will end. To whom thus Michael. Those whom last thou sawst In Triumph and luxurious wealth, are they First seen in acts of prowess eminent And great exploits, but of true vertu void; Who having spilt much blood, and don much waste Subduing Nations, and achievd thereby Fame in the World, high titles, and rich prey, Shall change thir course to pleasure, ease, and sloth, Surfet, and lust, till wantonness and pride Raise out of friendship hostil deeds in Peace. The conquerd also, and enslav&amp;#39;d by Warr Shall with thir freedom lost all vertu loose And fear of God, from whom thir pietie feign&amp;#39;d In sharp contest of Battel found no aide Against invaders; therefore coold in zeale Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure, Worldlie or dissolute, on what thir Lords Shall leave them to enjoy; for th&amp;#39; Earth shall bear More then anough, that temperance may be tri&amp;#39;d: So all shall turn degenerate, all deprav&amp;#39;d, Justice and Temperance, Truth and Faith forgot; One Man except, the onely Son of light In a dark Age, against example good, Against allurement, custom, and a World Offended; fearless of reproach and scorn, Or violence, hee of thir wicked wayes Shall them admonish, and before them set The paths of righteousness, how much more safe, And full of peace, denouncing wrauth to come On thir impenitence; and shall returne Of them derided, but of God observd The one just Man alive; by his command Shall build a wondrous Ark, as thou beheldst, To save himself and household from amidst A World devote to universal rack. No sooner hee with them of Man and Beast Select for life shall in the Ark be lodg&amp;#39;d, And shelterd round, but all the Cataracts Of Heav&amp;#39;n set open on the Earth shall powre Raine day and night, all fountains of the Deep Broke up, shall heave the Ocean to usurp Beyond all bounds, till inundation rise Above the highest Hills: then shall this Mount Of Paradise by might of Waves be moovd Out of his place, pushd by the horned floud, With all his verdure spoil&amp;#39;d, and Trees adrift Down the great River to the op&amp;#39;ning Gulf, And there take root an Iland salt and bare, The haunt of Seales and Orcs, and Sea-mews clang. To teach thee that God attributes to place No sanctitie, if none be thither brought By Men who there frequent, or therein dwell. And now what further shall ensue, behold. He lookd, and saw the Ark hull on the floud, Which now abated, for the Clouds were fled, Drivn by a keen North-winde, that blowing drie Wrinkl&amp;#39;d the face of Deluge, as decai&amp;#39;d; And the cleer Sun on his wide watrie Glass Gaz&amp;#39;d hot, and of the fresh Wave largely drew, As after thirst, which made thir flowing shrink From standing lake to tripping ebbe, that stole With soft foot towards the deep, who now had stopt His Sluces, as the Heav&amp;#39;n his windows shut. The Ark no more now flotes, but seems on ground Fast on the top of som high mountain fixt. And now the tops of Hills as Rocks appeer; With clamor thence the rapid Currents drive Towards the retreating Sea thir furious tyde. Forthwith from out the Arke a Raven flies, And after him, the surer messenger, A Dove sent forth once and agen to spie Green Tree or ground whereon his foot may light; The second time returning, in his Bill An Olive leafe he brings, pacific signe: Anon drie ground appeers, and from his Arke The ancient Sire descends with all his Train; Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout, Grateful to Heav&amp;#39;n, over his head beholds A dewie Cloud, and in the Cloud a Bow Conspicuous with three listed colours gay, Betok&amp;#39;ning peace from God, and Cov&amp;#39;nant new. Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad Greatly rejoyc&amp;#39;d, and thus his joy broke forth. O thou who future things canst represent As present, Heav&amp;#39;nly instructer, I revive At this last sight, assur&amp;#39;d that Man shall live With all the Creatures, and thir seed preserve. Farr less I now lament for one whole World Of wicked Sons destroyd, then I rejoyce For one Man found so perfet and so just, That God voutsafes to raise another World From him, and all his anger to forget. But say, what mean those colourd streaks in Heavn, Distended as the Brow of God appeas&amp;#39;d, Or serve they as a flourie verge to binde The fluid skirts of that same watrie Cloud, Least it again dissolve and showr the Earth? To whom th&amp;#39; Archangel. Dextrously thou aim&amp;#39;st; So willingly doth God remit his Ire, Though late repenting him of Man deprav&amp;#39;d, Griev&amp;#39;d at his heart, when looking down he saw The whole Earth fill&amp;#39;d with violence, and all flesh Corrupting each thir way; yet those remoov&amp;#39;d, Such grace shall one just Man find in his sight, That he relents, not to blot out mankind, And makes a Covenant never to destroy The Earth again by flood, nor let the Sea Surpass his bounds, nor Rain to drown the World With Man therein or Beast; but when he brings Over the Earth a Cloud, will therein set His triple-colour&amp;#39;d Bow, whereon to look And call to mind his Cov&amp;#39;nant: Day and Night, Seed time and Harvest, Heat and hoary Frost Shall hold thir course, till fire purge all things new, Both Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;AS one who in his journey bates at Noone, Though bent on speed, so heer the Archangel paus&amp;#39;d Betwixt the world destroy&amp;#39;d and world restor&amp;#39;d, If Adam aught perhaps might interpose; Then with transition sweet new Speech resumes. Thus thou hast seen one World begin and end; And Man as from a second stock proceed. Much thou hast yet to see, but I perceave Thy mortal sight to faile; objects divine Must needs impaire and wearie human sense: Henceforth what is to com I will relate, Thou therefore give due audience, and attend. This second sours of Men, while yet but few; And while the dread of judgement past remains Fresh in thir mindes, fearing the Deitie, With some regard to what is just and right Shall lead thir lives, and multiplie apace, Labouring the soile, and reaping plenteous crop, Corn wine and oyle; and from the herd or flock, Oft sacrificing Bullock, Lamb, or Kid, With large Wine-offerings pour&amp;#39;d, and sacred Feast, Shal spend thir dayes in joy unblam&amp;#39;d, and dwell Long time in peace by Families and Tribes Under paternal rule; till one shall rise Of proud ambitious heart, who not content With fair equalitie, fraternal state, Will arrogate Dominion undeserv&amp;#39;d Over his brethren, and quite dispossess Concord and law of Nature from the Earth; Hunting (and Men not Beasts shall be his game) With Warr and hostile snare such as refuse Subjection to his Empire tyrannous: A mightie Hunter thence he shall be styl&amp;#39;d Before the Lord, as in despite of Heav&amp;#39;n, Or from Heav&amp;#39;n claming second Sovrantie; And from Rebellion shall derive his name, Though of Rebellion others he accuse. Hee with a crew, whom like Ambition joyns With him or under him to tyrannize, Marching from Eden towards the West, shall finde The Plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge Boiles out from under ground, the mouth of Hell; Of Brick, and of that stuff they cast to build A Citie and Towre, whose top may reach to Heav&amp;#39;n; And get themselves a name, least far disperst In foraign Lands thir memorie be lost Regardless whether good or evil fame. But God who oft descends to visit men Unseen, and through thir habitations walks To mark thir doings, them beholding soon, Comes down to see thir Citie, ere the Tower Obstruct Heav&amp;#39;n Towrs, and in derision sets Upon thir Tongues a various Spirit to rase Quite out thir Native Language, and instead To sow a jangling noise of words unknown: Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud Among the Builders; each to other calls Not understood, till hoarse, and all in rage, As mockt they storm; great laughter was in Heav&amp;#39;n And looking down, to see the hubbub strange And hear the din; thus was the building left Ridiculous, and the work Confusion nam&amp;#39;d. Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeas&amp;#39;d. O execrable Son so to aspire Above his Brethren, to himself assuming Authoritie usurpt, from God not giv&amp;#39;n: He gave us onely over Beast, Fish, Fowl Dominion absolute; that right we hold By his donation; but Man over men He made not Lord; such title to himself Reserving, human left from human free. But this Usurper his encroachment proud Stayes not on Man; to God his Tower intends Siege and defiance: Wretched man! what food Will he convey up thither to sustain Himself and his rash Armie, where thin Aire Above the Clouds will pine his entrails gross, And famish him of Breath, if not of Bread? To whom thus Michael. Justly thou abhorr&amp;#39;st That Son, who on the quiet state of men Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue Rational Libertie; yet know withall, Since thy original lapse, true Libertie Is lost, which alwayes with right Reason dwells Twinn&amp;#39;d, and from her hath no dividual being: Reason in man obscur&amp;#39;d, or not obeyd, Immediately inordinate desires And upstart Passions catch the Government From Reason, and to servitude reduce Man till then free. Therefore since hee permits Within himself unworthie Powers to reign Over free Reason, God in judgement just Subjects him from without to violent Lords; Who oft as undeservedly enthrall His outward freedom: Tyrannie must be, Though to the Tyrant thereby no excuse. Yet somtimes Nations will decline so low From vertue, which is reason, that no wrong, But Justice, and some fatal curse annext Deprives them of thir outward libertie, Thir inward lost: Witness th&amp;#39; irreverent Son Of him who built the Ark, who for the shame Don to his Father, heard this heavie curse, Servant of Seruants, on his vitious Race. Thus will this latter, as the former World, Still tend from bad to worse, till God at last Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw His presence from among them, and avert His holy Eyes; resolving from thenceforth To leave them to thir own polluted wayes; And one peculiar Nation to select From all the rest, of whom to be invok&amp;#39;d, A Nation from one faithful man to spring: Him on this side Euphrates yet residing, Bred up in Idol-worship; O that men (Canst thou believe?) should be so stupid grown, While yet the Patriark liv&amp;#39;d, who scap&amp;#39;d the Flood, As to forsake the living God, and fall To worship thir own work in Wood and Stone For Gods! yet him God the most High voutsafes To call by Vision from his Fathers house, His kindred and false Gods, into a Land Which he will shew him, and from him will raise A mightie Nation, and upon him showre His benediction so, that in his Seed All Nations shall be blest; he straight obeys, Not knowing to what Land, yet firm believes: I see him, but thou canst not, with what Faith He leaves his Gods, his Friends, and native Soile Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the Ford To Haran, after him a cumbrous Train Of Herds and Flocks, and numerous servitude; Not wandring poor, but trusting all his wealth With God, who call&amp;#39;d him, in a land unknown. Canaan he now attains, I see his Tents Pitcht about Sechem, and the neighbouring Plaine Of Moreh; there by promise he receaves Gift to his Progenie of all that Land; From Hamath Northward to the Desert South (Things by thir names I call, though yet unnam&amp;#39;d) From Hermon East to the great Western Sea, Mount Hermon, yonder Sea, each place behold In prospect, as I point them; on the shoare Mount Carmel; here the double-founted stream Jordan, true limit Eastward; but his Sons Shall dwell to Senir, that long ridge of Hills. This ponder, that all Nations of the Earth Shall in his Seed be blessed; by that Seed Is meant thy great deliverer, who shall bruise The Serpents head; whereof to thee anon Plainlier shall be reveald. This Patriarch blest, Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call, A Son, and of his Son a Grand-childe leaves, Like him in faith, in wisdom, and renown; The Grandchilde with twelve Sons increast, departs From Canaan, to a Land hereafter call&amp;#39;d Egypt, divided by the River Nile; See where it flows, disgorging at seaven mouthes Into the Sea: to sojourn in that Land He comes invited by a yonger Son In time of dearth, a Son whose worthy deeds Raise him to be the second in that Realme Of Pharao: there he dies, and leaves his Race Growing into a Nation, and now grown Suspected to a sequent King, who seeks To stop thir overgrowth, as inmate guests Too numerous; whence of guests he makes them slaves Inhospitably, and kills thir infant Males: Till by two brethren (those two brethren call Moses and Aaron) sent from God to claime His people from enthralment, they return With glory and spoile back to thir promis&amp;#39;d Land. But first the lawless Tyrant, who denies To know thir God, or message to regard, Must be compelld by Signes and judgements dire; To blood unshed the Rivers must be turnd, Frogs, Lice and Flies must all his Palace fill With loath&amp;#39;d intrusion, and fill all the land; His Cattel must of Rot and Murren die, Botches and blaines must all his flesh imboss, And all his people; Thunder mixt with Haile, Haile mixt with fire must rend th&amp;#39; Egyptian Skie And wheel on th&amp;#39; Earth, devouring where it rouls; What it devours not, Herb, or Fruit, or Graine, A darksom Cloud of Locusts swarming down Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green: Darkness must overshadow all his bounds, Palpable darkness, and blot out three dayes; Last with one midnight stroke all the first-born Of Egypt must lie dead. Thus with ten wounds The River-dragon tam&amp;#39;d at length submits To let his sojourners depart, and oft Humbles his stubborn heart, but still as Ice More hard&amp;#39;nd after thaw, till in his rage Pursuing whom he late dismissd, the Sea Swallows him with his Host, but them lets pass As on drie land between two christal walls, Aw&amp;#39;d by the rod of Moses so to stand Divided, till his rescu&amp;#39;d gain thir shoar: Such wondrous power God to his Saint will lend, Though present in his Angel, who shall goe Before them in a Cloud, and Pillar of Fire, By day a Cloud, by night a Pillar of Fire, To guide them in thir journey, and remove Behinde them, while th&amp;#39; obdurat King pursues: All night he will pursue, but his approach Darkness defends between till morning Watch; Then through the Firey Pillar and the Cloud God looking forth will trouble all his Host And craze thir Chariot wheels: when by command Moses once more his potent Rod extends Over the Sea; the Sea his Rod obeys; On thir imbattelld ranks the Waves return, And overwhelm thir Warr: the Race elect Safe towards Canaan from the shoar advance Through the wilde Desert, not the readiest way, Least entring on the Canaanite allarmd Warr terrifie them inexpert, and feare Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather Inglorious life with servitude; for life To noble and ignoble is more sweet Untraind in Armes, where rashness leads not on. This also shall they gain by thir delay In the wide Wilderness, there they shall found Thir government, and thir great Senate choose Through the twelve Tribes, to rule by Laws ordaind: God from the Mount of Sinai, whose gray top Shall tremble, he descending, will himself In Thunder Lightning and loud Trumpets sound Ordaine them Lawes; part such as appertaine To civil Justice, part religious Rites Of sacrifice, informing them, by types And shadows, of that destind Seed to bruise The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve Mankinds deliverance. But the voice of God To mortal eare is dreadful; they beseech That Moses might report to them his will, And terror cease; he grants what they besaught Instructed that to God is no access Without Mediator, whose high Office now Moses in figure beares, to introduce One greater, of whose day he shall foretell, And all the Prophets in thir Age the times Of great Messiah shall sing. Thus Laws and Rites Establisht, such delight hath God in Men Obedient to his will, that he voutsafes Among them to set up his Tabernacle, The holy One with mortal Men to dwell: By his prescript a Sanctuary is fram&amp;#39;d Of Cedar, overlaid with Gold, therein An Ark, and in the Ark his Testimony, The Records of his Cov&amp;#39;nant, over these A Mercie-seat of Gold between the wings Of two bright Cherubim, before him burn Seaven Lamps as in a Zodiac representing The Heav&amp;#39;nly fires; over the Tent a Cloud Shall rest by Day, a fiery gleame by Night, Save when they journie, and at length they come, Conducted by his Angel to the Land Promisd to Abraham and his Seed: the rest Were long to tell, how many Battels fought, How many Kings destroyd, and Kingdoms won, Or how the Sun shall in mid Heav&amp;#39;n stand still A day entire, and Nights due course adjourne, Mans voice commanding, Sun in Gibeon stand, And thou Moon in the vale of Aialon, Till Israel overcome; so call the third From Abraham, Son of Isaac, and from him His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win. Here Adam interpos&amp;#39;d. O sent from Heav&amp;#39;n, Enlightner of my darkness, gracious things Thou hast reveald, those chiefly which concerne Just Abraham and his Seed: now first I finde Mine eyes true op&amp;#39;ning, and my heart much eas&amp;#39;d, Erwhile perplext with thoughts what would becom Of mee and all Mankind; but now I see His day, in whom all Nations shall be blest, Favour unmerited by me, who sought Forbidd&amp;#39;n knowledge by forbidd&amp;#39;n means. This yet I apprehend not, why to those Among whom God will deigne to dwell on Earth So many and so various Laws are giv&amp;#39;n; So many Laws argue so many sins Among them; how can God with such reside? To whom thus Michael. Doubt not but that sin Will reign among them, as of thee begot; And therefore was Law given them to evince Thir natural pravitie, by stirring up Sin against Law to fight; that when they see Law can discover sin, but not remove, Save by those shadowie expiations weak, The bloud of Bulls and Goats, they may conclude Some bloud more precious must be paid for Man, Just for unjust, that in such righteousness To them by Faith imputed, they may finde Justification towards God, and peace Of Conscience, which the Law by Ceremonies Cannot appease, nor Man the moral part Perform, and not performing cannot live. So law appears imperfet, and but giv&amp;#39;n With purpose to resign them in full time Up to a better Cov&amp;#39;nant, disciplin&amp;#39;d From shadowie Types to Truth, from Flesh to Spirit, From imposition of strict Laws, to free Acceptance of large Grace, from servil fear To filial, works of Law to works of Faith. And therefore shall not Moses, though of God Highly belov&amp;#39;d, being but the Minister Of Law, his people into Canaan lead; But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call, His Name and Office bearing, who shall quell The adversarie Serpent, and bring back Through the worlds wilderness long wanderd man Safe to eternal Paradise of rest. Meanwhile they in thir earthly Canaan plac&amp;#39;t Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins National interrupt thir public peace, Provoking God to raise them enemies: From whom as oft he saves them penitent By Judges first, then under Kings; of whom The second, both for pietie renownd And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive Irrevocable, that his Regal Throne For ever shall endure; the like shall sing All Prophecie, That of the Royal Stock Of David (so I name this King) shall rise A Son, the Womans Seed to thee foretold, Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust All Nations, and to Kings foretold, of Kings The last, for of his Reign shall be no end. But first a long succession must ensue, And his next Son for Wealth and Wisdom fam&amp;#39;d, The clouded Ark of God till then in Tents Wandring, shall in a glorious Temple enshrine. Such follow him, as shall be registerd Part good, part bad, of bad the longer scrowle, Whose foul Idolatries, and other faults Heapt to the popular summe, will so incense God, as to leave them, and expose thir Land, Thir Citie, his Temple, and his holy Ark With all his sacred things, a scorn and prey To that proud Citie, whose high Walls thou saw&amp;#39;st Left in confusion, Babylon thence call&amp;#39;d. There in captivitie he lets them dwell The space of seventie years, then brings them back, Remembring mercie, and his Cov&amp;#39;nant sworn To David, stablisht as the dayes of Heav&amp;#39;n. Returnd from Babylon by leave of Kings Thir Lords, whom God dispos&amp;#39;d, the house of God They first re-edifie, and for a while In mean estate live moderate, till grown In wealth and multitude, factious they grow; But first among the Priests dissension springs, Men who attend the Altar, and should most Endeavour Peace: thir strife pollution brings Upon the Temple it self: at last they seise The Scepter, and regard not Davids Sons, Then loose it to a stranger, that the true Anointed King Messiah might be born Barr&amp;#39;d of his right; yet at his Birth a Starr Unseen before in Heav&amp;#39;n proclaims him com, And guides the Eastern Sages, who enquire His place, to offer Incense, Myrrh, and Gold; His place of birth a solemn Angel tells To simple Shepherds, keeping watch by night; They gladly thither haste, and by a Quire Of squadrond Angels hear his Carol sung. A Virgin is his Mother, but his Sire The Power of the most High; he shall ascend The Throne hereditarie, and bound his Reign With earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heav&amp;#39;ns. He ceas&amp;#39;d, discerning Adam with such joy Surcharg&amp;#39;d, as had like grief bin dew&amp;#39;d in tears, Without the vent of words, which these he breathd. O Prophet of glad tidings, finisher Of utmost hope! now clear I understand What oft my steddiest thoughts have searcht in vain, Why our great expectation should be call&amp;#39;d The seed of Woman: Virgin Mother, Haile, High in the love of Heav&amp;#39;n, yet from my Loynes Thou shalt proceed, and from thy Womb the Son Of God most High; So God with man unites. Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise Expect with mortal paine: say where and when Thir fight, what stroke shall bruise the Victors heel. To whom thus Michael. Dream not of thir fight, As of a Duel, or the local wounds Of head or heel: not therefore joynes the Son Manhood to God-head, with more strength to foil Thy enemie; nor so is overcome Satan, whose fall from Heav&amp;#39;n, a deadlier bruise, Disabl&amp;#39;d not to give thee thy deaths wound: Which hee, who comes thy Saviour, shall recure, Not by destroying Satan, but his works In thee and in thy Seed: nor can this be, But by fulfilling that which thou didst want, Obedience to the Law of God, impos&amp;#39;d On penaltie of death, and suffering death, The penaltie to thy transgression due, And due to theirs which out of thine will grow: So onely can high Justice rest appaid. The Law of God exact he shall fulfill Both by obedience and by love, though love Alone fulfill the Law; thy punishment He shall endure by coming in the Flesh To a reproachful life and cursed death, Proclaiming Life to all who shall believe In his redemption, and that his obedience Imputed becomes theirs by Faith, his merits To save them, not thir own, though legal works. For this he shall live hated, be blasphem&amp;#39;d, Seis&amp;#39;d on by force, judg&amp;#39;d, and to death condemnd A shameful and accurst, naild to the Cross By his own Nation, slaine for bringing Life; But to the Cross he nailes thy Enemies, The Law that is against thee, and the sins Of all mankinde, with him there crucifi&amp;#39;d, Never to hurt them more who rightly trust In this his satisfaction; so he dies, But soon revives, Death over him no power Shall long usurp; ere the third dawning light Returne, the Starres of Morn shall see him rise Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light, Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems, His death for Man, as many as offerd Life Neglect not, and the benefit imbrace By Faith not void of workes: this God-like act Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldst have dy&amp;#39;d, In sin for ever lost from life; this act Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength Defeating Sin and Death, his two maine armes, And fix farr deeper in his head thir stings Then temporal death shall bruise the Victors heel, Or theirs whom he redeems, a death like sleep, A gentle wafting to immortal Life. Nor after resurrection shall he stay Longer on Earth then certaine times to appeer To his Disciples, Men who in his Life Still follow&amp;#39;d him; to them shall leave in charge To teach all nations what of him they learn&amp;#39;d And his Salvation, them who shall beleeve Baptizing in the profluent stream, the signe Of washing them from guilt of sin to Life Pure, and in mind prepar&amp;#39;d, if so befall, For death, like that which the redeemer dy&amp;#39;d. All Nations they shall teach; for from that day Not onely to the Sons of Abrahams Loines Salvation shall be Preacht, but to the Sons Of Abrahams Faith wherever through the world; So in his seed all Nations shall be blest. Then to the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heav&amp;#39;ns he shall ascend With victory, triumphing through the aire Over his foes and thine; there shall surprise The Serpent, Prince of aire, and drag in Chaines Through all his Realme, and there confounded leave; Then enter into glory, and resume His Seat at Gods right hand, exalted high Above all names in Heav&amp;#39;n; and thence shall come, When this worlds disolution shall be ripe, With glory and power to judge both quick and dead, To judge th&amp;#39; unfaithful dead, but to reward His faithful, and receave them into bliss, Whether in Heav&amp;#39;n or Earth, for then the Earth Shall all be Paradise, far happier place Then this of Eden, and far happier daies. So spake th&amp;#39; Archangel Michael, then paus&amp;#39;d, As at the Worlds great period; and our Sire Replete with joy and wonder thus repli&amp;#39;d. O goodness infinite, goodness immense! That all this good of evil shall produce, And evil turn to good; more wonderful Then that which by creation first brought forth Light out of darkness! full of doubt I stand, Whether I should repent me now of sin By mee done and occasiond, or rejoyce Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring, To God more glory, more good will to Men From God, and over wrauth grace shall abound. But say, if our deliverer up to Heav&amp;#39;n Must reascend, what will betide the few His faithful, left among th&amp;#39; unfaithful herd, The enemies of truth; who then shall guide His people, who defend? will they not deale Wors with his followers then with him they dealt? Be sure they will, said th&amp;#39; Angel; but from Heav&amp;#39;n Hee to his own a Comforter will send, The promise of the Father, who shall dwell His Spirit within them, and the Law of Faith Working through love, upon thir hearts shall write, To guide them in all truth, and also arme With spiritual Armour, able to resist Satans assaults, and quench his fierie darts, What man can do against them, not affraid, Though to the death, against such cruelties With inward consolations recompenc&amp;#39;t, And oft supported so as shall amaze Thir proudest persecuters: for the Spirit Powrd first on his Apostles, whom he sends To evangelize the Nations, then on all Baptiz&amp;#39;d, shall them with wondrous gifts endue To speak all Tongues, and do all Miracles, As did thir Lord before them. Thus they win Great numbers of each Nation to receave With joy the tidings brought from Heav&amp;#39;n: at length Thir Ministry perform&amp;#39;d, and race well run, Thir doctrine and thir story written left, They die; but in thir room, as they forewarne, Wolves shall succeed for teachers, grievous Wolves, Who all the sacred mysteries of Heav&amp;#39;n To thir own vile advantages shall turne Of lucre and ambition, and the truth With superstitions and traditions taint, Left onely in those written Records pure, Though not but by the Spirit understood. Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names, Places and titles, and with these to joine Secular power, though feigning still to act By spiritual, to themselves appropriating The Spirit of God, promisd alike and giv&amp;#39;n To all Beleevers; and from that pretense, Spiritual Lawes by carnal power shall force On every conscience; Laws which none shall finde Left them inrould, or what the Spirit within Shall on the heart engrave. What will they then But force the Spirit of Grace it self, and binde His consort Libertie; what, but unbuild His living Temples, built by Faith to stand, Thir own Faith not anothers: for on Earth Who against Faith and Conscience can be heard Infallible? yet many will presume: Whence heavie persecution shall arise On all who in the worship persevere Of Spirit and Truth; the rest, farr greater part, Will deem in outward Rites and specious formes Religion satisfi&amp;#39;d; Truth shall retire Bestuck with slandrous darts, and works of Faith Rarely be found: so shall the World goe on, To good malignant, to bad men benigne, Under her own waight groaning till the day Appeer of respiration to the just, And vengeance to the wicked, at return Of him so lately promis&amp;#39;d to thy aid The Womans seed, obscurely then foretold, Now amplier known thy Saviour and thy Lord, Last in the Clouds from Heav&amp;#39;n to be reveald In glory of the Father, to dissolve Satan with his perverted World, then raise From the conflagrant mass, purg&amp;#39;d and refin&amp;#39;d, New Heav&amp;#39;ns, new Earth, Ages of endless date Founded in righteousness and peace and love To bring forth fruits Joy and eternal Bliss. He ended; and thus Adam last reply&amp;#39;d. How soon hath thy prediction, Seer blest, Measur&amp;#39;d this transient World, the Race of time, Till time stand fixt: beyond is all abyss, Eternitie, whose end no eye can reach. Greatly instructed I shall hence depart, Greatly in peace of thought, and have my fill Of knowledge, what this Vessel can containe; Beyond which was my folly to aspire. Henceforth I learne, that to obey is best, And love with fear the onely God, to walk As in his presence, ever to observe His providence, and on him sole depend, Mercifull over all his works, with good Still overcoming evil, and by small Accomplishing great things, by things deemd weak Subverting worldly strong, and worldly wise By simply meek; that suffering for Truths sake Is fortitude to highest victorie, And to the faithful Death the Gate of Life; Taught this by his example whom I now Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest. To whom thus also th&amp;#39; Angel last repli&amp;#39;d: This having learnt, thou hast attaind the summe Of wisdome; hope no higher, though all the Starrs Thou knewst by name, and all th&amp;#39; ethereal Powers, All secrets of the deep, all Natures works, Or works of God in Heav&amp;#39;n, Aire, Earth, or Sea, And all the riches of this World enjoydst, And all the rule, one Empire; onely add Deeds to thy knowledge answerable, add Faith, Add vertue, Patience, Temperance, add Love, By name to come call&amp;#39;d Charitie, the soul Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loath To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess A paradise within thee, happier farr. Let us descend now therefore from this top Of Speculation; for the hour precise Exacts our parting hence; and see the Guards, By mee encampt on yonder Hill, expect Thir motion, at whose Front a flaming Sword, In signal of remove, waves fiercely round; We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve; Her also I with gentle Dreams have calm&amp;#39;d Portending good, and all her spirits compos&amp;#39;d To meek submission: thou at season fit Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard, Chiefly what may concern her Faith to know, The great deliverance by her Seed to come (For by the Womans Seed) on all Mankind. That ye may live, which will be many dayes, Both in one Faith unanimous though sad, With cause for evils past, yet much more cheer&amp;#39;d With meditation on the happie end. He ended, and they both descend the Hill; Descended, Adam to the Bowre where Eve Lay sleeping ran before, but found her wak&amp;#39;t; And thus with words not sad she him receav&amp;#39;d. Whence thou returnst, and whither wentst, I know; For God is also in sleep, and Dreams advise, Which he hath sent propitious, some great good Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress Wearied I fell asleep: but now lead on; In mee is no delay; with thee to goe, Is to stay here; without thee here to stay, Is to go hence unwilling; thou to mee Art all things under Heav&amp;#39;n, all places thou, Who for my wilful crime art banisht hence. This further consolation yet secure I carry hence; though all by mee is lost, Such favour I unworthie am voutsaft, By mee the Promis&amp;#39;d Seed shall all restore. So spake our Mother Eve, and Adam heard Well pleas&amp;#39;d, but answer&amp;#39;d not; for now too nigh Th&amp;#39; Archangel stood, and from the other Hill To thir fixt Station, all in bright array The Cherubim descended; on the ground Gliding meteorous, as Ev&amp;#39;ning Mist Ris&amp;#39;n from a River o&amp;#39;re the marish glides, And gathers ground fast at the Labourers heel Homeward returning. High in Front advanc&amp;#39;t, The brandisht Sword of God before them blaz&amp;#39;d Fierce as a Comet; which with torrid heat, And vapour as the Libyan Air adust, Began to parch that temperate Clime; whereat In either hand the hastning Angel caught Our lingring Parents, and to th&amp;#39; Eastern Gate Led them direct, and down the Cliff as fast To the subjected Plaine; then disappeer&amp;#39;d. They looking back, all th&amp;#39; Eastern side beheld Of Paradise, so late thir happie seat, Wav&amp;#39;d over by that flaming Brand, the Gate With dreadful Faces throng&amp;#39;d and fierie Armes: Som natural tears they drop&amp;#39;d, but wip&amp;#39;d them soon; The World was all before them, where to choose Thir place of rest, and Providence thir guide: They hand in hand with wandring steps and slow, Through Eden took thir solitarie way.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;HIgh on a Throne of Royal State, which far Outshon the wealth of Ormus and of Ind, Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand Showrs on her Kings Barbaric Pearl and Gold, Satan exalted sat, by merit rais&amp;#39;d To that bad eminence; and from despair Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue Vain Warr with Heav&amp;#39;n, and by success untaught His proud imaginations thus displaid. Powers and Dominions, Deities of Heav&amp;#39;n, For since no deep within her gulf can hold Immortal vigor, though opprest and fall&amp;#39;n, I give not Heav&amp;#39;n for lost. From this descent Celestial vertues rising, will appear More glorious and more dread then from no fall, And trust themselves to fear no second fate: Mee though just right, and the fixt Laws of Heav&amp;#39;n Did first create your Leader, next free choice, With what besides, in Counsel or in Fight, Hath bin achievd of merit, yet this loss Thus farr at least recover&amp;#39;d, hath much more Establisht in a safe unenvied Throne Yielded with full consent. The happier state In Heav&amp;#39;n, which follows dignity, might draw Envy from each inferior; but who here Will envy whom the highest place exposes Formost to stand against the Thunderers aim Your bulwark, and condemns to greatest share Of endless pain? where there is then no good For which to strive, no strife can grow up there From Faction; for none sure will claim in Hell Precedence, none, whose portion is so small Of present pain, that with ambitious mind Will covet more. With this advantage then To union, and firm Faith, and firm accord, More then can be in Heav&amp;#39;n, we now return To claim our just inheritance of old, Surer to prosper then prosperity Could have assur&amp;#39;d us; and by what best way, Whether of open Warr or covert guile, We now debate; who can advise, may speak. He ceas&amp;#39;d, and next him Moloc, Scepter&amp;#39;d King Stood up, the strongest and the fiercest Spirit That fought in Heav&amp;#39;n; now fiercer by despair: His trust was with th&amp;#39; Eternal to be deem&amp;#39;d Equal in strength, and rather then be less Car&amp;#39;d not to be at all; with that care lost Went all his fear: of God, or Hell, or worse He reck&amp;#39;d not, and these words thereafter spake. My sentence is for open Warr: Of Wiles, More unexpert, I boast not: them let those Contrive who need, or when they need, not now. For while they sit contriving, shall the rest, Millions that stand in Arms, and longing wait The Signal to ascend, sit lingring here Heav&amp;#39;ns fugitives, and for thir dwelling place Accept this dark opprobrious Den of shame, The Prison of his Tyranny who Reigns By our delay? no, let us rather choose Arm&amp;#39;d with Hell flames and fury all at once O&amp;#39;re Heav&amp;#39;ns high Towrs to force resistless way, Turning our Tortures into horrid Arms Against the Torturer; when to meet the noise Of his Almighty Engin he shall hear Infernal Thunder, and for Lightning see Black fire and horror shot with equal rage Among his Angels; and his Throne it self Mixt with Tartarean Sulphur, and strange fire, His own invented Torments. But perhaps The way seems difficult and steep to scale With upright wing against a higher foe. Let such bethink them, if the sleepy drench Of that forgetful Lake benumm not still, That in our proper motion we ascend Up to our native seat: descent and fall To us is adverse. Who but felt of late When the fierce Foe hung on our brok&amp;#39;n Rear Insulting, and pursu&amp;#39;d us through the Deep, With what compulsion and laborious flight We sunk thus low? Th&amp;#39; ascent is easie then; Th&amp;#39; event is fear&amp;#39;d; should we again provoke Our stronger, some worse way his wrath may find To our destruction: if there be in Hell Fear to be worse destroy&amp;#39;d: what can be worse Then to dwell here, driv&amp;#39;n out from bliss, condemn&amp;#39;d In this abhorred deep to utter woe; Where pain of unextinguishable fire Must exercise us without hope of end The Vassals of his anger, when the Scourge Inexorably, and the torturing hour Calls us to Penance? More destroy&amp;#39;d then thus We should be quite abolisht and expire. What fear we then? what doubt we to incense His utmost ire? which to the highth enrag&amp;#39;d, Will either quite consume us, and reduce To nothing this essential, happier farr Then miserable to have eternal being: Or if our substance be indeed Divine, And cannot cease to be, we are at worst On this side nothing; and by proof we feel Our power sufficient to disturb his Heav&amp;#39;n, And with perpetual inrodes to Allarme, Though inaccessible, his fatal Throne: Which if not Victory is yet Revenge. He ended frowning, and his look denounc&amp;#39;d Desperate revenge, and Battel dangerous To less then Gods. On th&amp;#39; other side up rose Belial, in act more graceful and humane; A fairer person lost not Heav&amp;#39;n; he seemd For dignity compos&amp;#39;d and high exploit: But all was false and hollow; though his Tongue Dropt Manna, and could make the worse appear The better reason, to perplex and dash Maturest Counsels: for his thoughts were low; To vice industrious, but to Nobler deeds Timorous and slothful: yet he pleas&amp;#39;d the ear, And with perswasive accent thus began. I should be much for open Warr, O Peers, As not behind in hate; if what was urg&amp;#39;d Main reason to perswade immediate Warr, Did not disswade me most, and seem to cast Ominous conjecture on the whole success: When he who most excels in fact of Arms, In what he counsels and in what excels Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair And utter dissolution, as the scope Of all his aim, after some dire revenge. First, what Revenge? the Towrs of Heav&amp;#39;n are fill&amp;#39;d With Armed watch, that render all access Impregnable; oft on the bordering Deep Encamp thir Legions, or with obscure wing Scout farr and wide into the Realm of night, Scorning surprize. Or could we break our way By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise With blackest Insurrection, to confound Heav&amp;#39;ns purest Light, yet our great Enemy All incorruptible would on his Throne Sit unpolluted, and th&amp;#39; Ethereal mould Incapable of stain would soon expel Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire Victorious. Thus repuls&amp;#39;d, our final hope Is flat despair: we must exasperate Th&amp;#39; Almighty Victor to spend all his rage, And that must end us, that must be our cure, To be no more; sad cure; for who would loose, Though full of pain, this intellectual being, Those thoughts that wander through Eternity, To perish rather, swallowd up and lost In the wide womb of uncreated night, Devoid of sense and motion? and who knows, Let this be good, whether our angry Foe Can give it, or will ever? how he can Is doubtful; that he never will is sure. Will he, so wise, let loose at once his ire, Belike through impotence, or unaware, To give his Enemies thir wish, and end Them in his anger, whom his anger saves To punish endless? wherefore cease we then? Say they who counsel Warr, we are decreed, Reserv&amp;#39;d and destin&amp;#39;d to Eternal woe; Whatever doing, what can we suffer more, What can we suffer worse? is this then worst, Thus sitting, thus consulting, thus in Arms? What when we fled amain, pursu&amp;#39;d and strook With Heav&amp;#39;ns afflicting Thunder, and besought The Deep to shelter us? this Hell then seem&amp;#39;d A refuge from those wounds: or when we lay Chain&amp;#39;d on the burning Lake? that sure was worse. What if the breath that kindl&amp;#39;d those grim fires Awak&amp;#39;d should blow them into sevenfold rage And plunge us in the flames? or from above Should intermitted vengeance arm again His red right hand to plague us? what if all Her stores were open&amp;#39;d, and this Firmament Of Hell should spout her Cataracts of Fire Impendent horrors, threatning hideous fall One day upon our heads; while we perhaps Designing or exhorting glorious warr, Caught in a fierie Tempest shall be hurl&amp;#39;d Each on his rock transfixt, the sport and prey Of racking whirlwinds, or for ever sunk Under yon boyling Ocean, wrapt in Chains; There to converse with everlasting groans, Unrespited, unpitied, unrepreevd, Ages of hopeless end; this would be worse. Warr therefore, open or conceal&amp;#39;d, alike My voice disswades; for what can force or guile With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye Views all things at one view? he from heav&amp;#39;ns highth All these our motions vain, sees and derides; Not more Almighty to resist our might Then wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles. Shall we then live thus vile, the Race of Heav&amp;#39;n Thus trampl&amp;#39;d, thus expell&amp;#39;d to suffer here Chains and these Torments? better these then worse By my advice; since fate inevitable Subdues us, and Omnipotent Decree, The Victors will. To suffer, as to doe, Our strength is equal, nor the Law unjust That so ordains: this was at first resolv&amp;#39;d, If we were wise, against so great a foe Contending, and so doubtful what might fall. I laugh, when those who at the Spear are bold And vent&amp;#39;rous, if that fail them, shrink and fear What yet they know must follow, to endure Exile, or ignominy, or bonds, or pain, The sentence of thir Conquerour: This is now Our doom; which if we can sustain and bear, Our Supream Foe in time may much remit His anger, and perhaps thus farr remov&amp;#39;d Not mind us not offending, satisfi&amp;#39;d With what is punish&amp;#39;t; whence these raging fires Will slack&amp;#39;n, if his breath stir not thir flames. Our purer essence then will overcome Thir noxious vapour, or enur&amp;#39;d not feel, Or chang&amp;#39;d at length, and to the place conformd In temper and in nature, will receive Familiar the fierce heat, and void of pain; This horror will grow milde, this darkness light, Besides what hope the never-ending flight Of future dayes may bring, what chance, what change Worth waiting, since our present lot appeers For happy though but ill, for ill not worst, If we procure not to our selves more woe. Thus Belial with words cloath&amp;#39;d in reasons garb Counsel&amp;#39;d ignoble ease, and peaceful sloath, Not peace: and after him thus Mammon spake. Either to disinthrone the King of Heav&amp;#39;n We warr, if warr be best, or to regain Our own right lost: him to unthrone we then May hope when everlasting Fathe shall yeild To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife: The former vain to hope argues as vain The latter: for what place can be for us Within Heav&amp;#39;ns bound, unless Heav&amp;#39;ns Lord supream We overpower? Suppose he should relent And publish Grace to all, on promise made Of new Subjection; with what eyes could we Stand in his presence humble, and receive Strict Laws impos&amp;#39;d, to celebrate his Throne With warbl&amp;#39;d Hymns, and to his God head sing Forc&amp;#39;t Halleluia&amp;#39;s; while he Lordly sits Our envied Sovran, and his Altar breathes Ambrosial Odours and Ambrosial Flowers, Our servile offerings. This must be our task In Heav&amp;#39;n this our delight; how wearisom Eternity so spent in worship paid To whom we hate. Let us not then pursue By force impossible, by leave obtain&amp;#39;d Unacceptable, though in Heav&amp;#39;n, our state Of splendid vassalage, but rather seek Our own good from our selves, and from our own Live to our selves, though in this vast recess, Free, and to none accountable, preferring Hard liberty before the easie yoke Of servile Pomp. Our greatness will appeer Then most conspicuous, when great things of small, Useful of hurtful, prosperous of adverse We can create, and in what place so e&amp;#39;re Thrive under evil, and work ease out of pain Through labour and indurance. This deep world Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst Thick clouds and dark doth Heav&amp;#39;ns all-ruling Sire Choose to reside, his Glory unobscur&amp;#39;d, And with the Majesty of darkness round Covers his Throne; from whence deep thunders roar Must&amp;#39;ring thir rage, and Heav&amp;#39;n resembles Hell? As he our darkness, cannot we his Light Imitate when we please? This Desart soile Wants not her hidden lustre, Gemms and Gold; Nor want we skill or Art, from whence to raise Magnificence; and what can Heav&amp;#39;n shew more? Our torments also may in length of time Become our Elements, these piercing Fires As soft as now severe, our temper chang&amp;#39;d Into their temper; which must needs remove The sensible of pain. All things invite To peaceful Counsels, and the settl&amp;#39;d State Of order, how in safety best we may Compose our present evils, with regard Of what we are and were, dismissing quite All thoughts of warr: ye have what I advise. He scarce had finisht, when such murmur filld Th&amp;#39; Assembly, as when hollow Rocks retain The sound of blustring winds, which all night long Had rous&amp;#39;d the Sea, now with hoarse cadence lull Sea-faring men orewatcht, whose Bark by chance Or Pinnace anchors in a craggy Bay After the Tempest: Such applause was heard As Mammon ended, and his Sentence pleas&amp;#39;d, Advising peace: for such another Field They dreaded worse then Hell: so much the fear Of Thunder and the Sword of Michael Wrought still within them; and no less desire To found this nether Empire, which might rise By pollicy, and long process of time, In emulation opposite to Heav&amp;#39;n. Which when Beelzebub perceiv&amp;#39;d, then whom, Satan except, none higher sat, with grave Aspect he rose, and in his rising seem&amp;#39;d A Pillar of State; deep on his Front engraven Deliberation sat and public care; And Princely counsel in his face yet shon, Majestic though in ruin: sage he stood With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear The weight of mightiest Monarchies; his look Drew audience and attention still as Night Or Summers Noon-tide air, while thus he spake. Thrones and Imperial Powers, off-spring of heav&amp;#39;n Ethereal Vertues; or these Titles now Must we renounce, and changing stile be call&amp;#39;d Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote Inclines, here to continue, and build up here A growing Empire; doubtless; while we dream, And know not that the King of Heav&amp;#39;n hath doom&amp;#39;d This place our dungeon, not our safe retreat Beyond his Potent arm, to live exempt From Heav&amp;#39;ns high jurisdiction, in new League Banded against his Throne, but to remaine In strictest bondage, though thus far remov&amp;#39;d, Under th&amp;#39; inevitable curb, reserv&amp;#39;d His captive multitude: For he, be sure In heighth or depth, still first and last will Reign Sole King, and of his Kingdom loose no part By our revolt, but over Hell extend His Empire, and with Iron Scepter rule Us here, as with his Golden those in Heav&amp;#39;n. What sit we then projecting peace and Warr? Warr hath determin&amp;#39;d us, and foild with loss Irreparable; tearms of peace yet none Voutsaf&amp;#39;t or sought; for what peace will be giv&amp;#39;n To us enslav&amp;#39;d, but custody severe, And stripes, and arbitrary punishment Inflicted? and what peace can we return, But to our power hostility and hate, Untam&amp;#39;d reluctance, and revenge though slow, Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least May reap his conquest, and may least rejoyce In doing what we most in suffering feel? Nor will occasion want, nor shall we need With dangerous expedition to invade Heav&amp;#39;n, whose high walls fear no assault or Siege, Or ambush from the Deep. What if we find Some easier enterprize? There is a place (If ancient and prophetic fame in Heav&amp;#39;n Err not) another World, the happy seat Of some new Race call&amp;#39;d Man, about this time To be created like to us, though less In power and excellence, but favour&amp;#39;d more Of him who rules above; so was his will Pronounc&amp;#39;d among the Gods, and by an Oath, That shook Heav&amp;#39;ns whol circumference, confirm&amp;#39;d. Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn What creatures there inhabit, of what mould, Or substance, how endu&amp;#39;d, and what thir Power, And where thir weakness, how attempted best, By force or suttlety: Though Heav&amp;#39;n be shut, And Heav&amp;#39;ns high Arbitrator sit secure In his own strength, this place may lye expos&amp;#39;d The utmost border of his Kingdom, left To their defence who hold it: here perhaps Som advantagious act may be achiev&amp;#39;d By sudden onset, either with Hell fire To waste his whole Creation, or possess All as our own, and drive as we were driven, The punie habitants, or if not drive, Seduce them to our Party, that thir God May prove thir foe, and with repenting hand Abolish his own works. This would surpass Common revenge, and interrupt his joy In our Confusion, and our joy upraise In his disturbance; when his darling Sons HurI&amp;#39;d headlong to partake with us, shall curse Thir frail Original, and faded bliss, Faded so soon. Advise if this be worth Attempting, or to sit in darkness here Hatching vain Empires. Thus Beelzebub Pleaded his devilish Counsel, first devis&amp;#39;d By Satan, and in part propos&amp;#39;d: for whence, But from the Author of all ill could Spring So deep a malice, to confound the race Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell To mingle and involve, done all to spite The great Creatour? But thir spite still serves His glory to augment. The bold design Pleas&amp;#39;d highly those infernal States, and joy Sparkl&amp;#39;d in all thir eyes; with full assent They vote: whereat his speech he thus renews. Well have ye judg&amp;#39;d, well ended long debate, Synod of Gods, and like to what ye are, Great things resolv&amp;#39;d; which from the lowest deep Will once more lift us up, in spight of Fate, Neerer our ancient Seat; perhaps in view Of those bright confines, whence with neighbouring Arms And opportune excursion we may chance Re-enter Heav&amp;#39;n; or else in some milde Zone Dwell not unvisited of Heav&amp;#39;ns fair Light Secure, and at the brightning Orient beam Purge off this gloom; the soft delicious Air, To heal the scarr of these corrosive Fires Shall breathe her balme. But first whom shall we send In search of this new world, whom shall we find Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandring feet The dark unbottom&amp;#39;d infinite Abyss And through the palpable obscure find out His uncouth way, or spread his aerie flight Upborn with indefatigable wings Over the vast abrupt, ere he arrive The happy Ile; what strength, what art can then Suffice, or what evasion bear him safe Through the strict Senteries and Stations thick Of Angels watching round? Here he had need All circumspection, and we now no less Choice in our suffrage; for on whom we send, The weight of all and our last hope relies. This said, he sat; and expectation held His look suspence, awaiting who appeer&amp;#39;d To second, or oppose, or undertake The perilous attempt: but all sat mute, Pondering the danger with deep thoughts; and each In others count&amp;#39;nance read his own dismay Astonisht: none among the choice and prime Of those Heav&amp;#39;n-warring Champions could be found So hardie as to proffer or accept Alone the dreadful voyage; till at last Satan, whom now transcendent glory rais&amp;#39;d Above his fellows, with Monarchal pride Conscious of highest worth, unmov&amp;#39;d thus spake. O Progeny of Heav&amp;#39;n, Empyreal Thrones, With reason hath deep silence and demurr Seis&amp;#39;d us, though undismaid: long is the way And hard, that out of Hell leads up to light; Our prison strong, this huge convex of Fire, Outrageous to devour, immures us round Ninefold, and gates of burning Adamant Barr&amp;#39;d over us prohibit all egress. These past, if any pass, the void profound Of unessential Night receives him next Wide gaping, and with utter loss of being Threatens him, plung&amp;#39;d in that abortive gulf. If thence he scape into whatever world, Or unknown Region, what remains him less Then unknown dangers and as hard escape. But I should ill become this Throne, O Peers, And this Imperial Sov&amp;#39;ranty, adorn&amp;#39;d With splendor, arm&amp;#39;d with power, if aught propos&amp;#39;d And judg&amp;#39;d of public moment, in the shape Of difficulty or danger could deterr Mee from attempting. Wherefore do I assume These Royalties, and not refuse to Reign, Refusing to accept as great a share Of hazard as of honour, due alike To him who Reigns, and so much to him due Of hazard more, as he above the rest High honourd sits? Go therfore mighty Powers, Terror of Heav&amp;#39;n, though fall&amp;#39;n; intend at home, While here shall be our home, what best may ease The present misery, and render Hell More tollerable; if there be cure or charm To respite or deceive, or slack the pain Of this ill Mansion: intermit no watch Against a wakeful Foe, while I abroad Through all the Coasts of dark destruction seek Deliverance for us all: this enterprize None shall partake with me. Thus saying rose The Monarch, and prevented all reply, Prudent, least from his resolution rais&amp;#39;d Others among the chief might offer now (Certain to be refus&amp;#39;d) what erst they feard; And so refus&amp;#39;d might in opinion stand His Rivals, winning cheap the high repute Which he through hazard huge must earn. But they Dreaded not more th&amp;#39; adventure then his voice Forbidding; and at once with him they rose; Thir rising all at once was as the sound Of Thunder heard remote. Towards him they bend With awful reverence prone; and as a God Extoll him equal to the highest in Heav&amp;#39;n: Nor fail&amp;#39;d they to express how much they prais&amp;#39;d, That for the general safety he despis&amp;#39;d His own: for neither do the Spirits damn&amp;#39;d Loose all thir virtue; least bad men should boast Thir specious deeds on earth, which glory excites, Or clos ambition varnisht o&amp;#39;re with zeal. Thus they thir doubtful consultations dark Ended rejoycing in thir matchless Chief: As when from mountain tops the dusky clouds Ascending, while the North wind sleeps, o&amp;#39;respread Heav&amp;#39;ns chearful face, the lowring Element Scowls ore the dark&amp;#39;nd lantskip Snow, or showre; If chance the radiant Sun with farewell sweet Extend his ev&amp;#39;ning beam, the fields revive, The birds thir notes renew, and bleating herds Attest thir joy, that hill and valley rings. O shame to men! Devil with Devil damn&amp;#39;d Firm concord holds, men onely disagree Of Creatures rational, though under hope Of heavenly Grace: and God proclaiming peace, Yet live in hatred, enmity, and strife Among themselves, and levie cruel warres, Wasting the Earth, each other to destroy: As if (which might induce us to accord) Man had not hellish foes anow besides, That day and night for his destruction waite. The Stygian Counsel thus dissolv&amp;#39;d; and forth In order came the grand infernal Peers, Midst came thir mighty Paramount, and seemd Alone th&amp;#39; Antagonist of Heav&amp;#39;n, nor less Than Hells dread Emperour with pomp Supream, And God-like imitated State; him round A Globe of fierie Seraphim inclos&amp;#39;d With bright imblazonrie, and horrent Arms. Then of thir Session ended they bid cry With Trumpets regal sound the great result: Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim Put to thir mouths the sounding Alchymie By Haralds voice explain&amp;#39;d: the hollow Abyss Heard farr and wide, and all the host of Hell With deafning shout, return&amp;#39;d them loud acclaim. Thence more at ease thir minds and somwhat rais&amp;#39;d By false presumptuous hope, the ranged powers Disband, and wandring, each his several way Pursues, as inclination or sad choice Leads him perplext, where he may likeliest find Truce to his restless thoughts, and entertain The irksom hours, till this great Chief return. Part on the Plain, or in the Air sublime Upon the wing, or in swift Race contend, As at th&amp;#39; Olympian Games or Pythian fields; Part curb thir fierie Steeds, or shun the Goal With rapid wheels, or fronted Brigads form. As when to warn proud Cities warr appears Wag&amp;#39;d in the troubl&amp;#39;d Skie, and Armies rush To Battel in the Clouds, before each Van Prick forth the Aerie Knights, and couch thir Spears Till thickest Legions close; with feats of Arms From either end of Heav&amp;#39;n the welkin burns. Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell Rend up both Rocks and Hills, and ride the Air In whirlwind; Hell scarce holds the wilde uproar. As when Alcides from Oechalia Crown&amp;#39;d With conquest, felt th&amp;#39; envenom&amp;#39;d robe, and tore Through pain up by the roots Thessalian Pines, And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw Into th&amp;#39; Euboic Sea. Others more milde, Retreated in a silent valley, sing With notes Angelical to many a Harp Thir own Heroic deeds and hapless fall By doom of Battel; and complain that Fate Free Vertue should enthrall to Force or Chance. Thir Song was partial, but the harmony (What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?) Suspended Hell, and took with ravishment The thronging audience. In discourse more sweet (For Eloquence the Soul, Song charms the Sense,) Others apart sat on a Hill retir&amp;#39;d, In thoughts more elevate, and reason&amp;#39;d high Of Providence, Foreknowledge, Will and Fate, Fixt Fate, free will, foreknowledg absolute, And found no end, in wandring mazes lost. Of good and evil much they argu&amp;#39;d then, Of happiness and final misery, Passion and Apathie, and glory and shame, Vain wisdom all, and false Philosophie: Yet with a pleasing sorcerie could charm Pain for a while or anguish, and excite Fallacious hope, or arm th&amp;#39; obdured brest With stubborn patience as with triple steel. Another part in Squadrons and gross Bands, On bold adventure to discover wide That dismal world, if any Clime perhaps Might yield them easier habitation, bend Four ways thir flying March, along the Banks Of four infernal Rivers that disgorge Into the burning Lake thir baleful streams; Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate, Sad Acheron of sorrow, black and deep; Cocytus, nam&amp;#39;d of lamentation loud Heard on the ruful stream; fierce Phlegeton Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage. Farr off from these a slow and silent stream, Lethe the River of Oblivion roules Her watrie Labyrinth, whereof who drinks, Forthwith his former state and being forgets, Forgets both joy and grief, pleasure and pain. Beyond this flood a frozen Continent Lies dark and wilde, beat with perpetual storms Of Whirlwind and dire Hail, which on firm land Thaws not, but gathers heap, and ruin seems Of ancient pile; all else deep snow and ice, A gulf profound as that Serbonian Bog Betwixt Damiata and mount Casius old, Where Armies whole have sunk: the parching Air Burns frore, and cold performs th&amp;#39; effect of Fire. Thither by harpy-footed Furies hail&amp;#39;d, At certain revolutions all the damn&amp;#39;d Are brought: and feel by turns the bitter change Of fierce extreams, extreams by change more fierce, From Beds of raging Fire to starve in Ice Thir soft Ethereal warmth, and there to pine Immovable, infixt, and frozen round, Periods of time, thence hurried back to fire. They ferry over this Lethean Sound Both to and fro, thir sorrow to augment, And wish and struggle, as they pass, to reach The tempting stream, with one small drop to loose In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe, All in one moment, and so neer the brink; But Fate withstands, and to oppose th&amp;#39; attempt Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards The Ford, and of it self the water flies All taste of living wight, as once it fled The lip of Tantalus. Thus roving on In confus&amp;#39;d march forlorn, th&amp;#39; adventrous Bands With shuddring horror pale, and eyes agast View&amp;#39;d first thir lamentable lot, and found No rest: through many a dark and drearie Vaile They pass&amp;#39;d, and many a Region dolorous, O&amp;#39;re many a Frozen, many a fierie Alpe, Rocks, Caves, Lakes, Fens, Bogs, Dens, and shades of death, A Universe of death, which God by curse Created evil, for evil only good, Where all life dies, death lives, and Nature breeds, Perverse, all monstrous, all prodigious things, Abominable, inutterable, and worse Than Fables yet have feign&amp;#39;d, or fear conceiv&amp;#39;d, Gorgons and Hydra&amp;#39;s, and Chimera&amp;#39;s dire. Mean while the Adversary of God and Man, Satan with thoughts inflam&amp;#39;d of highest design, Puts on swift wings, and towards the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight; som times He scours the right hand coast, som times the left, Now shaves with level wing the Deep, then soares Up to the fiery Concave touring high. As when farr off at Sea a Fleet descri&amp;#39;d Hangs in the Clouds, by Aequinoctial Winds Close sailing from Bengala, or the Iles Of Ternate and Tidore, whence Merchants bring Thir spicie Drugs: they on the Trading Flood Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape Ply stemming nightly toward the Pole. So seem&amp;#39;d Farr off the flying Fiend: at last appeer Hell bounds high reaching to the horrid Roof, And thrice threefold the Gates; three folds were Brass, Three Iron, three of Adamantine Rock, Impenetrable, impal&amp;#39;d with circling fire, Yet unconsum&amp;#39;d. Before the Gates there sat On either side a formidable shape; The one seem&amp;#39;d Woman to the waste, and fair, But ended foul in many a scaly fould Voluminous and vast, a Serpent arm&amp;#39;d With mortal sting: about her middle round A cry of Hell Hounds never ceasing bark&amp;#39;d With wide Cerberian mouths full loud, and rung A hideous Peal: yet, when they list, would creep, If aught disturb&amp;#39;d thir noyse, into her woomb, And kennel there, yet there still bark&amp;#39;d and howl&amp;#39;d, Within unseen. Farr less abhorrd than these Vex&amp;#39;d Scylla bathing in the Sea that parts Calabria from the hoarce Trinacrian shore: Nor uglier follow the Night-Hag, when call&amp;#39;d In secret, riding through the Air she comes Lur&amp;#39;d with the smell of infant blood, to dance With Lapland Witches, while the labouring Moon Eclipses at thir charms. The other shape, If shape it might be call&amp;#39;d that shape had none Distinguishable in member, joynt, or limb, Or substance might be call&amp;#39;d that shadow seem&amp;#39;d, For each seem&amp;#39;d either; black it stood as Night, Fierce as ten Furies, terrible as Hell, And shook a dreadful Dart; what seem&amp;#39;d his head The likeness of a Kingly Crown had on. Satan was now at hand, and from his seat The Monster moving onward came as fast With horrid strides, Hell trembled as he strode. Th&amp;#39; undaunted Fiend what this might be admir&amp;#39;d, Admir&amp;#39;d, not fear&amp;#39;d; God and his Son except, Created thing naught valu&amp;#39;d he nor shun&amp;#39;d; And with disdainful look thus first began. Whence and what art thou, execrable shape, That dar&amp;#39;st, though grim and terrible, advance Thy miscreated Front athwart my way To yonder Gates? through them I mean to pass, That be assur&amp;#39;d, without leave askt of thee: Retire, or taste thy folly, and learn by proof, Hell-born, not to contend with Spirits of Heav&amp;#39;n. To whom the Goblin full of wrauth reply&amp;#39;d, Art thou that Traitor Angel, art thou hee, Who first broke peace in Heav&amp;#39;n and Faith, till then Unbrok&amp;#39;n, and in proud rebellious Arms Drew after him the third part of Heav&amp;#39;ns Sons Conjur&amp;#39;d against the highest, for which both Thou And they outcast from God, are here condemn&amp;#39;d To waste Eternal dayes in woe and pain? And reck&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;st thou thy self with Spirits of Heav&amp;#39;n, Hell-doom&amp;#39;d, and breath&amp;#39;st defiance here and scorn Where I reign King, and to enrage thee more, Thy King and Lord? Back to thy punishment, False fugitive, and to thy speed add wings, Least with a whip of Scorpions I pursue Thy lingring, or with one stroke of this Dart Strange horror seise thee, and pangs unfelt before. So spake the grieslie terrour, and in shape, So speaking and so threatning, grew tenfold More dreadful and deform: on th&amp;#39; other side Incenst with indignation Satan stood Unterrifi&amp;#39;d, and like a Comet burn&amp;#39;d, That fires the length of Ophiucus huge In th&amp;#39; Artick Sky, and from his horrid hair Shakes Pestilence and Warr. Each at the Head Level&amp;#39;d his deadly aime; thir fatall hands No second stroke intend, and such a frown Each cast at th&amp;#39; other, as when two black Clouds With Heav&amp;#39;ns Artillery fraught, come rattling on Over the Caspian, then stand front to front Hov&amp;#39;ring a space, till Winds the signal blow To joyn thir dark Encounter in mid air: So frownd the mighty Combatants, that Hell Grew darker at thir frown, so matcht they stood; For never but once more was either like To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds Had been achiev&amp;#39;d, whereof all Hell had rung, Had not the Snakie Sorceress that sat Fast by Hell Gate, and kept the fatal Key, Ris&amp;#39;n, and with hideous outcry rush&amp;#39;d between. O Father, what intends thy hand, she cry&amp;#39;d, Against thy only Son? What fury O Son, Possesses thee to bend that mortal Dart Against thy Fathers head? and know&amp;#39;st for whom; For him who sits above and laughs the while At thee ordain&amp;#39;d his drudge, to execute What e&amp;#39;re his wrath, which he calls justice, bids, His wrath which one day will destroy ye both. She spake, and at her words the hellish Pest Forbore, then these to her Satan return&amp;#39;d: So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange Thou interposest, that my sudden hand Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds What it intends; till first I know of thee, What thing thou art, thus double-form&amp;#39;d, and why In this infernal Vaile first met thou call&amp;#39;st Me Father, and that Fantasm ca11&amp;#39;st my Son? I know thee not, nor ever saw till now Sight more detestable then him and thee. T&amp;#39; whom thus the Portress of Hell Gate reply&amp;#39;d; Hast thou forgot me then, and do I seem Now in thine eyes so foul, once deemd so fair In Heav&amp;#39;n, when at th&amp;#39; Assembly, and in sight Of all the Seraphim with thee combin&amp;#39;d In bold conspiracy against Heav&amp;#39;ns King, All on a sudden miserable pain Surpris&amp;#39;d thee, dim thine eyes, and dizzie swumm In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast Threw forth, till on the left side op&amp;#39;ning wide, Likest to thee in shape and count&amp;#39;nance bright, Then shining heav&amp;#39;nly fair, a Goddess arm&amp;#39;d Out of thy head I sprung: amazement seis&amp;#39;d All th&amp;#39; Host of Heav&amp;#39;n; back they recoild affraid At first, and call&amp;#39;d me Sin, and for a Sign Portentous held me; but familiar grown, I pleas&amp;#39;d, and with attractive graces won The most averse, thee chiefly, who full oft Thy self in me thy perfect image viewing Becam&amp;#39;st enamour&amp;#39;d, and such joy thou took&amp;#39;st With me in secret, that my womb conceiv&amp;#39;d A growing burden. Mean while Warr arose, And fields were fought in Heav&amp;#39;n; wherein remaind (For what could else) to our Almighty Foe Cleer Victory, to our part loss and rout Through all the Empyrean: down they fell Driv&amp;#39;n headlong from the Pitch of Heaven, down Into this Deep, and in the general fall I also; at which time this powerful Key Into my hand was giv&amp;#39;n, with charge to keep These Gates for ever shut, which none can pass Without my op&amp;#39;ning. Pensive here I sat Alone, but long I sat not, till my womb Pregnant by thee, and now excessive grown Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes. At last this odious offspring whom thou seest Thine own begotten, breaking violent way Tore through my entrails, that with fear and pain Distorted, all my nether shape thus grew Transform&amp;#39;d: but he my inbred enemie Forth issu&amp;#39;d, brandishing his fatal Dart Made to destroy: I fled, and cry&amp;#39;d out Death; Hell trembl&amp;#39;d at the hideous Name, and sigh&amp;#39;d From all her Caves, and back resounded Death. I fled, but he pursu&amp;#39;d (though more, it seems, Inflam&amp;#39;d with lust then rage) and swifter far, Mee overtook his mother all dismaid, And in embraces forcible and foule Ingendring with me, of that rape begot These yelling Monsters that with ceasless cry Surround me, as thou sawst, hourly conceiv&amp;#39;d And hourly born, with sorrow infinite To me, for when they list into the womb That bred them they return, and howle and gnaw My Bowels, thir repast; then bursting forth A fresh with conscious terrours vex me round, That rest or intermission none I find. Before mine eyes in opposition sits Grim Death my Son and foe, who sets them on, And me his Parent would full soon devour For want of other prey, but that he knows His end with mine involvd; and knows that I Should prove a bitter Morsel, and his bane, When ever that shall be; so Fate pronounc&amp;#39;d. But thou O Father, I forewarn thee, shun His deadly arrow; neither vainly hope To be invulnerable in those bright Arms, Though temper&amp;#39;d heav&amp;#39;nly, for that mortal dint, Save he who reigns above, none can resist. She finish&amp;#39;d, and the suttle Fiend his lore Soon learnd, now milder, and thus answerd smooth. Dear Daughter, since thou claim&amp;#39;st me for thy Sire, And my fair Son here showst me, the dear pledge Of dalliance had with thee in Heav&amp;#39;n, and joys Then sweet, now sad to mention, through dire change Befalln us unforeseen, unthought of, know I come no enemie, but to set free From out this dark and dismal house of pain, Both him and thee, and all the heav&amp;#39;nly Host Of Spirits that in our just pretenses arm&amp;#39;d Fell with us from on high: from them I go This uncouth errand sole, and one for all My self expose, with lonely steps to tread Th&amp;#39; unfounded deep, and through the void immense To search with wandring quest a place foretold Should be, and, by concurring signs, ere now Created vast and round, a place of bliss In the Pourlieues of Heav&amp;#39;n, and therein plac&amp;#39;t A race of upstart Creatures, to supply Perhaps our vacant room, though more remov&amp;#39;d, Least Heav&amp;#39;n surcharg&amp;#39;d with potent multitude Might hap to move new broiles: Be this or aught Then this more secret now design&amp;#39;d, I haste To know, and this once known, shall soon return, And bring ye to the place where Thou and Death Shall dwell at ease, and up and down unseen Wing silently the buxom Air, imbalm&amp;#39;d With odours; there ye shall be fed and fill&amp;#39;d Immeasurably, all things shall be your prey. He ceas&amp;#39;d, for both seemd highly pleasd, and Death Grinnd horrible a gastly smile, to hear His famine should be fill&amp;#39;d, and blest his mawe Destin&amp;#39;d to that good hour: no less rejoyc&amp;#39;d His mother bad, and thus bespake her Sire. The key of this infernal Pit by due, And by command of Heav&amp;#39;ns all-powerful King I keep, by him forbidden to unlock These Adamantine Gates; against all force Death ready stands to interpose his dart, Fearless to be o&amp;#39;rmatcht by living might. But what ow I to his commands above Who hates me, and hath hither thrust me down Into this gloom of Tartarus profound, To sit in hateful Office here confin&amp;#39;d, Inhabitant of Heav&amp;#39;n, and heav&amp;#39;nlie-born, Here in perpetual agonie and pain, With terrors and with clamors compasst round Of mine own brood, that on my bowels feed: Thou art my Father, thou my Author, thou My being gav&amp;#39;st me; whom should I obey But thee, whom follow? thou wilt bring me soon To that new world of light and bliss, among The Gods who live at ease, where I shall Reign At thy right hand voluptuous, as beseems Thy daughter and thy darling, without end. Thus saying, from her side the fatal Key, Sad instrument of all our woe, she took; And towards the Gate rouling her bestial train, Forthwith the huge Porcullis high up drew, Which but her self not all the Stygian powers Could once have mov&amp;#39;d; then in the key-hole turns Th&amp;#39; intricate wards, and every Bolt and Bar Of massie Iron or sollid Rock with ease Unfast&amp;#39;ns: on a sudden op&amp;#39;n flie With impetuous recoile and jarring sound Th&amp;#39; infernal dores, and on thir hinges grate Harsh Thunder, that the lowest bottom shook Of Erebus. She op&amp;#39;nd, but to shut Excel&amp;#39;d her power; the Gates wide op&amp;#39;n stood, That with extended wings a Bannerd Host Under spread Ensigns marching might pass through With Horse and Chariots rankt in loose array; So wide they stood, and like a Furnace mouth Cast forth redounding smoak and ruddy flame. Before thir eyes in sudden view appear The secrets of the hoarie deep, a dark Illimitable Ocean without bound, Without dimension, where length, breadth, &amp;amp; highth, And time and place are lost; where eldest Night And Chaos. Ancestors of Nature, hold Eternal Anarchie, amidst the noise Of endless Warrs, and by confusion stand. For hot, cold, moist, and dry, four Champions fierce Strive here for Maistrie, and to Battel bring Thir embryon Atoms; they around the flag Of each his Faction, in thir several Clanns, Light-arm&amp;#39;d or heavy, sharp, smooth, swift or slow, Swarm populous, unnumber&amp;#39;d as the Sands Of Barca or Cyrene&amp;#39;s torrid soil, Levied to side with warring Winds, and poise Thir lighter wings. To whom these most adhere, Hee rules a moment; Chaos Umpire sits, And by decision more imbroiles the fray By which he Reigns: next him high Arbiter Chance governs all. Into this wilde Abyss, The Womb of nature and perhaps her Grave, Of neither Sea, nor Shore, nor Air, nor Fire, But all these in thir pregnant causes mixt Confus&amp;#39;dly, and which thus must ever fight, Unless th&amp;#39; Almighty Maker them ordain His dark materials to create more Worlds, Into this wild Abyss the warie fiend Stood on the brink of Hell and look&amp;#39;d a while, Pondering his Voyage; for no narrow frith He had to cross. Nor was his eare less peal&amp;#39;d With noises loud and ruinous (to compare Great things with small) then when Bellona storms, With all her battering Engines bent to rase Som Capital City; or less then if this frame Of Heav&amp;#39;n were falling, and these Elements In mutinie had from her Axle torn The stedfast Earth. At last his Sail-broad Vannes He spreads for flight, and in the surging smoak Uplifted spurns the ground, thence many a League As in a cloudy Chair ascending rides Audacious, but that seat soon failing, meets A vast vacuitie: all unawares Fluttring his pennons vain plumb down he drops Ten thousand fadom deep, and to this hour Down had been falling, had not by ill chance The strong rebuff of som tumultuous cloud Instinct with Fire and Nitre hurried him As many miles aloft: that furie stay&amp;#39;d, Quencht in a Boggie Syrtis, neither Sea, Nor good dry Land: nigh founderd on he fares, Treading the crude consistence, half on foot, Half flying; behoves him now both Oare and Saile. As when a Gryfon through the Wilderness With winged course ore Hill or moarie Dale, Pursues the Arimaspian, who by stelth Had from his wakeful custody purloind The guarded Gold: So eagerly the fiend Ore bog or steep, through strait, rough, dense, or rare, With head, hands, wings or feet pursues his way, And swims or sinks, or wades, or creeps, or flyes: At length a universal hubbub wilde Of stunning sounds and voices all confus&amp;#39;d Born through the hollow dark assaults his eare With loudest vehemence: thither he plyes, Undaunted to meet there what ever power Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss Might in that noise reside, of whom to ask Which way the neerest coast of darkness lyes Bordering on light; when strait behold the Throne Of Chaos, and his dark Pavilion spread Wide on the wasteful Deep; with him Enthron&amp;#39;d Sat Sable-vested Night, eldest of things, The Consort of his Reign; and by them stood Orcus and Ades, and the dreaded name Of Demogorgon; Rumor next and Chance, And Tumult and Confusion all imbroild, And Discord with a thousand various mouths. T&amp;#39; whom Satan turning boldly, thus. Ye Powers And Spirits of this nethermost Abyss, Chaos and ancient Night, I come no Spy, With purpose to explore or to disturb The secrets of your Realm, but by constraint Wandring this darksome Desart, as my way, Lies through your spacious Empire up to light, Alone, and without guide, half lost, I seek What readiest path leads where your gloomie bounds Confine with Heav&amp;#39;n; or if som other place From your Dominion won, th&amp;#39; Ethereal King Possesses lately, thither to arrive I travel this profound, direct my course; Directed no mean recompence it brings To your behoof, if I that Region lost, All usurpation thence expell&amp;#39;d, reduce To her original darkness and your sway (Which is my present journey) and once more Erect the Standard there of ancient Night; Yours be th&amp;#39; advantage all, mine the revenge. Thus Satan; and him thus the Anarch old With faultring speech and visage incompos&amp;#39;d Answer&amp;#39;d. I know thee, stranger, who thou art, That mighty leading Angel, who of late Made head against Heav&amp;#39;ns King, though overthrown. I saw and heard, for such a numerous Host Fled not in silence through the frighted deep With ruin upon ruin, rout on rout, Confusion worse confounded; and Heav&amp;#39;n Gates Pourd out by millions her victorious Bands Pursuing. I upon my Frontieres here Keep residence; if all I can will serve, That little which is left so to defend, Encroacht on still through our intestine broiles Weakning the Scepter of old Night: first Hell Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath; Now lately Heaven and Earth, another World Hung ore my Realm, link&amp;#39;d in a golden Chain To that side Heav&amp;#39;n from whence your Legions fell: If that way be your walk, you have not farr; So much the neerer danger; go and speed; Havock and spoil and ruin are my gain. He ceas&amp;#39;d; and Satan staid not to reply, But glad that now his Sea should find a shore, With fresh alacritie and force renew&amp;#39;d Springs upward like a Pyramid of fire Into the wilde expanse, and through the shock Of fighting Elements, on all sides round Environ&amp;#39;d wins his way; harder beset And more endanger&amp;#39;d, then when Argo pass&amp;#39;d Through Bosporus betwixt the justling Rocks: Or when Ulysses on the Larbord shunnd Charybdis, and by th&amp;#39; other whirlpool steard. So he with difficulty and labour hard Mov&amp;#39;d on, with difficulty and labour hee; But hee once past, soon after when man fell, Strange alteration! Sin and Death amain Following his track, such was the will of Heav&amp;#39;n, Pav&amp;#39;d after him a broad and beat&amp;#39;n way Over the dark Abyss, whose boiling Gulf Tamely endur&amp;#39;d a Bridge of wondrous length From Hell continu&amp;#39;d reaching th&amp;#39; utmost Orbe Of this frail World; by which the Spirits perverse With easie intercourse pass to and fro To tempt or punish mortals, except whom God and good Angels guard by special grace. But now at last the sacred influence Of light appears, and from the walls of Heav&amp;#39;n Shoots farr into the bosom of dim Night A glimmering dawn; here Nature first begins Her fardest verge, and Chaos to retire As from her outmost works a brok&amp;#39;d foe With tumult less and with less hostile din, That Satan with less toil, and now with ease Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light And like a weather-beaten Vessel holds Gladly the Port, though Shrouds and Tackle torn; Or in the emptier waste, resembling Air, Weighs his spread wings, at leasure to behold Farr off th&amp;#39; Empyreal Heav&amp;#39;n, extended wide In circuit, undetermind square or round, With Opal Towrs and Battlements adorn&amp;#39;d Of living Saphire, once his native Seat; And fast by hanging in a golden Chain This pendant world, in bigness as a Starr Of smallest Magnitude close by the Moon. Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge, Accurst, and in a cursed hour he hies.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;HAil holy Light, ofspring of Heav&amp;#39;n first-born, Or of th&amp;#39; Eternal Coeternal beam May I express thee unblam&amp;#39;d? since God is light, And never but in unapproached light Dwelt from Eternitie, dwelt then in thee, Bright effluence of bright essence increate. Or hear&amp;#39;st thou rather pure Ethereal stream, Whose Fountain who shall tell? before the Sun, Before the Heavens thou wert, and at the voice Of God, as with a Mantle didst invest The rising world of waters dark and deep, Won from the void and formless infinite. Thee I re-visit now with bolder wing, Escap&amp;#39;t the Stygian Pool, though long detain&amp;#39;d In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight Through utter and through middle darkness borne With other notes then to th&amp;#39; Orphean Lyre I sung of Chaos and Eternal Night, Taught by the heav&amp;#39;nly Muse to venture down The dark descent, and up to reascend, Though hard and rare: thee I revisit safe, And feel thy sovran vital Lamp; but thou Revisit&amp;#39;st not these eyes, that rowle in vain To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn; So thick a drop serene hath quencht thir Orbs, Or dim suffusion veild. Yet not the more Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt Cleer Spring, or shadie Grove, or Sunnie Hill, Smit with the love of sacred Song; but chief Thee Sion and the flowrie Brooks beneath That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow, Nightly I visit: nor somtimes forget Those other two equal&amp;#39;d with me in Fate, So were I equal&amp;#39;d with them in renown, Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides, And Tiresias and Phineus Prophets old. Then feed on thoughts, that voluntarie move Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful Bird Sings darkling, and in shadiest Covert hid Tunes her nocturnal Note. Thus with the Year Seasons return, but not to me returns Day, or the sweet approach of Ev&amp;#39;n or Morn, Or sight of vernal bloom, or Summers Rose, Or flocks, or heards, or human face divine; But cloud in stead, and ever-during dark Surrounds me, from the chearful wayes of men Cut off, and for the Book of knowledg fair Presented with a Universal blanc Of Natures works to mee expung&amp;#39;d and ras&amp;#39;d, And wisdome at one entrance quite shut out. So much the rather thou Celestial light Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers Irradiate, there plant eyes, all mist from thence Purge and disperse, that I may see and tell Of things invisible to mortal sight. Now had the Almighty Father from above, From the pure Empyrean where he sits High Thron&amp;#39;d above all highth, bent down his eye, His own works and their works at once to view: About him all the Sanctities of Heaven Stood thick as Starrs, and from his sight receiv&amp;#39;d Beatitude past utterance; on his right The radiant image of his Glory sat, His onely Son; On Earth he first beheld Our two first Parents, yet the onely two Of mankind, in the happie Garden plac&amp;#39;t, Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love, Uninterrupted joy, unrivald love In blissful solitude; he then survey&amp;#39;d Hell and the Gulf between, and Satan there Coasting the wall of Heav&amp;#39;n on this side Night In the dun Air sublime, and ready now To stoop with wearied wings, and willing feet On the bare outside of this World, that seem&amp;#39;d Firm land imbosom&amp;#39;d without Firmament, Uncertain which, in Ocean or in Air. Him God beholding from his prospect high, Wherein past, present, future he beholds, Thus to his onely Son foreseeing spake. Onely begotten Son, seest thou what rage Transports our adversarie, whom no bounds Prescrib&amp;#39;d, no barrs of Hell, nor all the chains Heapt on him there, nor yet the main Abyss Wide interrupt can hold; so bent he seems On desparate reveng, that shall redound Upon his own rebellious head. And now Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way Not farr off Heav&amp;#39;n, in the Precincts of light, Directly towards the new created World, And Man there plac&amp;#39;t, with purpose to assay If him by force he can destroy, or worse, By some false guile pervert; and shall pervert For man will hark&amp;#39;n to his glozing lyes, And easily transgress the sole Command, Sole pledge of his obedience: So will fall, Hee and his faithless Progenie: whose fault? Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee All he could have; I made him just and right, Sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. Such I created all th&amp;#39; Ethereal Powers And Spirits, both them who stood and them who faild; Freely they stood who stood, and fell who fell. Not free, what proof could they have givn sincere Of true allegiance, constant Faith or Love, Where onely what they needs must do, appeard, Not what they would? what praise could they receive? What pleasure I from such obedience paid, When Will and Reason (Reason also is choice) Useless and vain, of freedom both despoild, Made passive both, had servd necessitie, Not mee. They therefore as to right belongd, So were created, nor can justly accuse Thir maker, or thir making, or thir Fate, As if predestination over-rul&amp;#39;d Thir will, dispos&amp;#39;d by absolute Decree Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed Thir own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault, Which had no less prov&amp;#39;d certain unforeknown. So without least impulse or shadow of Fate, Or aught by me immutablie foreseen, They trespass, Authors to themselves in all Both what they judge and what they choose; for so I formd them free, and free they must remain, Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change Thir nature, and revoke the high Decree Unchangeable, Eternal, which ordain&amp;#39;d Thir freedom, they themselves ordain&amp;#39;d thir fall. The first sort by thir own suggestion fell, Self-tempted, self-deprav&amp;#39;d: Man falls deceiv&amp;#39;d By the other first: Man therefore shall find grace, The other none: in Mercy and Justice both, Through Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, so shall my glorie excel, But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine. Thus while God spake, ambrosial fragrance fill&amp;#39;d All Heav&amp;#39;n, and in the blessed Spirits elect Sense of new joy ineffable diffus&amp;#39;d: Beyond compare the Son of God was seen Most glorious, in him all his Father shon Substantially express&amp;#39;d, and in his face Divine compassion visibly appeerd, Love without end, and without measure Grace, Which uttering thus he to his Father spake. O Father, gracious was that word which clos&amp;#39;d Thy sovran sentence, that Man should find grace; For which both Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth shall high extoll Thy praises, with th&amp;#39; innumerable sound Of Hymns and sacred Songs, wherewith thy Throne Encompass&amp;#39;d shall resound thee ever blest. For should Man finally be lost, should Man Thy creature late so lov&amp;#39;d, thy youngest Son Fall circumvented thus by fraud, though joynd With his own folly? that be from thee farr, That farr be from thee, Father, who art Judg Of all things made, and judgest onely right. Or shall the Adversarie thus obtain His end, and frustrate thine, shall he fulfill His malice, and thy goodness bring to naught, Or proud return though to his heavier doom, Yet with revenge accomplish&amp;#39;t and to Hell Draw after him the whole Race of mankind, By him corrupted? or wilt thou thy self Abolish thy Creation, and unmake, For him, what for thy glorie thou hast made? So should thy goodness and thy greatness both Be questiond and blaspheam&amp;#39;d without defence. To whom the great Creatour thus reply&amp;#39;d. O Son, in whom my Soul hath chief delight, Son of my bosom, Son who art alone My word, my wisdom, and effectual might, All hast thou spok&amp;#39;n as my thoughts are, all As my Eternal purpose hath decreed: Man shall not quite be lost, but sav&amp;#39;d who will, Yet not of will in him, but grace in me Freely voutsaft; once more I will renew His lapsed powers, though forfeit and enthrall&amp;#39;d By sin to foul exorbitant desires; Upheld by me, yet once more he shall stand On even ground against his mortal foe, By me upheld, that he may know how frail His fall&amp;#39;n condition is, and to me ow All his deliv&amp;#39;rance, and to none but me. Some I have chosen of peculiar grace Elect above the rest; so is my will: The rest shall hear me call, and oft be warnd Thir sinful state, and to appease betimes Th&amp;#39; incensed Deitie, while offerd grace Invites; for I will cleer thir senses dark, What may sufflce, and soft&amp;#39;n stonie hearts To pray, repent, and bring obedience due. To Prayer, repentance, and obedience due, Though but endevord with sincere intent, Mine ear shall not be slow, mine eye not shut. And I will place within them as a guide My Umpire Conscience, whom if they will hear, Light after light well us&amp;#39;d they shall attain, And to the end persisting, safe arrive. This my long sufferance and my day of grace They who neglect and scorn, shall never taste; But hard be hard&amp;#39;nd, blind be blinded more, That they may stumble on, and deeper fall; And none but such from mercy I exclude. But yet all is not don; Man disobeying, Disloyal breaks his fealtie, and sinns Against the high Supremacie of Heav&amp;#39;n, Affecting God-head, and so loosing all, To expiate his Treason hath naught left, But to destruction sacred and devote, He with his whole posteritie must dye, Dye hee or Justice must; unless for him Som other able, and as willing, pay The rigid satisfaction, death for death. Say Heav&amp;#39;nly powers, where shall we find such love, Which of ye will be mortal to redeem Mans mortal crime, and just th&amp;#39; unjust to save, Dwels in all Heaven charitie so deare? He ask&amp;#39;d, but all the Heav&amp;#39;nly Quire stood mute, And silence was in Heav&amp;#39;n: on mans behalf Patron or Intercessor none appeerd, Much less that durst upon his own head draw The deadly forfeiture, and ransom set. And now without redemption all mankind Must have bin lost, adjudg&amp;#39;d to Death and Hell By doom severe, had not the Son of God, In whom the fulness dwels of love divine, His dearest mediation thus renewd. Father, thy word is past, man shall find grace; And shall grace not find means, that finds her way, The speediest of thy winged messengers, To visit all thy creatures, and to all Comes unprevented, unimplor&amp;#39;d, unsought, Happie for man, so coming; he her aide Can never seek, once dead in sins and lost; Attonement for himself or offering meet, Indebted and undon, hath none to bring: Behold mee then, mee for him, life for life I offer, on mee let thine anger fall; Account mee man; I for his sake will leave Thy bosom, and this glorie next to thee Freely put off, and for him lastly dye Well pleas&amp;#39;d, on me let Death wreck all his rage; Under his gloomie power I shall not long Lie vanquisht; thou hast givn me to possess Life in my self for ever, by thee I live, Though now to Death I yield, and am his due All that of me can die, yet that debt paid, Thou wilt not leave me in the loathsom grave His prey, nor suffer my unspotted Soule For ever with corruption there to dwell; But I shall rise Victorious, and subdue My vanquisher, spoild of his vanted spoile; Death his deaths wound shall then receive, and stoop Inglorious, of his mortall sting disarm&amp;#39;d. I through the ample Air in Triumph high Shall lead Hell Captive maugre Hell, and show The powers of darkness bound. Thou at the sight Pleas&amp;#39;d, out of Heaven shalt look down and smile, While by thee rais&amp;#39;d I ruin all my Foes, Death last, and with his Carcass glut the Grave: Then with the multitude of my redeemd Shall enter Heaven long absent, and returne, Father, to see thy face, wherein no cloud Of anger shall remain, but peace assur&amp;#39;d, And reconcilement; wrauth shall be no more Thenceforth, but in thy presence joy entire. His words here ended, but his meek aspect Silent yet spake, and breath&amp;#39;d immortal love To mortal men, above which only shon Filial obedience: as a sacrifice Glad to be offer&amp;#39;d, he attends the will Of his great Father. Admiration seis&amp;#39;d All Heav&amp;#39;n, what this might mean, and whither tend Wondring; but soon th&amp;#39; Almighty thus reply&amp;#39;d: O thou in Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth the only peace Found out for mankind under wrauth, O thou My sole complacence! well thou know&amp;#39;st how dear, To me are all my works, nor Man the least Though last created, that for him I spare Thee from my bosom and right hand, to save, By loosing thee a while, the whole Race lost. Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem, Thir Nature also to thy Nature joyn; And be thy self Man among men on Earth, Made flesh, when time shall be, of Virgin seed, By wondrous birth: Be thou in Adams room The Head of all mankind, though Adams Son. As in him perish all men, so in thee As from a second root shall be restor&amp;#39;d, As many as are restor&amp;#39;d, without thee none. His crime makes guiltie all his Sons, thy merit Imputed shall absolve them who renounce Thir own both righteous and unrighteous deeds, And live in thee transplanted, and from thee Receive new life. So Man, as is most just, Shall satisfie for Man, be judg&amp;#39;d and die, And dying rise, and rising with him raise His Brethren, ransomd with his own dear life. So Heav&amp;#39;nly love shall outdoo Hellish hate Giving to death, and dying to redeeme, So dearly to redeem what Hellish hate So easily destroy&amp;#39;d, and still destroyes In those who, when they may, accept not grace. Nor shalt thou by descending to assume Mans Nature, less&amp;#39;n or degrade thine owne. Because thou hast, though Thron&amp;#39;d in highest bliss Equal to God, and equally enjoying God-like fruition, quitted all to save A World from utter loss, and hast been found By Merit more then Birthright Son of God, Found worthiest to be so by being Good, Farr more then Great or High; because in thee Love hath abounded more then Glory abounds, Therefore thy Humiliation shall exalt With thee thy Manhood also to this Throne; Here shalt thou sit incarnate, here shalt Reign Both God and Man, Son both of God and Man, Anointed universal King, all Power I give thee, reign for ever, and assume Thy Merits; under thee as Head Supream Thrones, Princedoms, Powers, Dominions I reduce: All knees to thee shall bow, of them that bide In Heaven, or Earth, or under Earth in Hell; When thou attended gloriously from Heav&amp;#39;n Shalt in the Sky appeer, and from thee send The summoning Arch-Angels to proclaime Thy dread Tribunal: forthwith from all Windes The living, and forthwith the cited dead Of all past Ages to the general Doom Shall hast&amp;#39;n, such a peal shall rouse thir sleep. Then all thy Saints assembl&amp;#39;d, thou shalt judge Bad men and Angels, they arraignd shall sink Beneath thy Sentence; Hell, her numbers full, Thenceforth shall be for ever shut. Mean while The World shall burn, and from her ashes spring New Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell, And after all thir tribulations long See golden days, fruitful of golden deeds, With Joy and Love triumphing, and fair Truth. Then thou thy regal Scepter shalt lay by, For regal Scepter then no more shall need, God shall be All in All. But all ye Gods, Adore him, who to compass all this dies, Adore the Son, and honour him as mee. No sooner had th&amp;#39; Almighty ceas&amp;#39;t, but all The multitude of Angels with a shout Loud as from numbers without number, sweet As from blest voices, uttering joy, Heav&amp;#39;n rung With Jubilee, and loud Hosanna&amp;#39;s filld Th&amp;#39; eternal Regions: lowly reverent Towards either Throne they bow, and to the ground With solemn adoration down they cast Thir Crowns inwove with Amarant and Gold, Immortal Amarant, a Flour which once In Paradise, fast by the Tree of Life Began to bloom, but soon for mans offence To Heav&amp;#39;n remov&amp;#39;d where first it grew, there grows, And flours aloft shading the Fount of Life, And where the river of Bliss through midst of Heavn Rowls o&amp;#39;re Elisian Flours her Amber stream; With these that never fade the Spirits elect Bind thir resplendent locks inwreath&amp;#39;d with beams, Now in loose Garlands thick thrown off, the bright Pavement that like a Sea of Jasper shon Impurpl&amp;#39;d with Celestial Roses smil&amp;#39;d. Then Crown&amp;#39;d again thir gold&amp;#39;n Harps they took, Harps ever tun&amp;#39;d, that glittering by thir side Like Quivers hung, and with Praeamble sweet Of charming symphonie they introduce Thir sacred Song, and waken raptures high; No voice exempt, no voice but well could joine Melodious part, such concord is in Heav&amp;#39;n. Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent, Immutable, Immortal, Infinite, Eternal King; thee Author of all being, Fountain of Light, thy self invisible Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sit&amp;#39;st Thron&amp;#39;d inaccessible, but when thou shad&amp;#39;st The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud Drawn round about thee like a radiant Shrine, Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appeer, Yet dazle Heav&amp;#39;n, that brightest Seraphim Approach not, but with both wings veil thir eyes. Thee next they sang of all Creation first, Begotten Son, Divine Similitude, In whose conspicuous count&amp;#39;nance, without cloud Made visible, th&amp;#39; Almighty Father shines, Whom else no Creature can behold; on thee Impresst the effulgence of his Glorie abides, Transfus&amp;#39;d on thee his ample Spirit rests. Hee Heav&amp;#39;n of Heavens and all the Powers therein By thee created, and by thee threw down Th&amp;#39; aspiring Dominations: thou that day Thy Fathers dreadful Thunder didst not spare, Nor stop thy flaming Chariot wheels, that shook Heav&amp;#39;ns everlasting Frame, while o&amp;#39;re the necks Thou drov&amp;#39;st of warring Angels disarraid. Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaime Thee only extoll&amp;#39;d, Son of thy Fathers might, To execute fierce vengeance on his foes, Not so on Man; him through their malice fall&amp;#39;n, Father of Mercie and Grace, thou didst not doome So strictly, but much more to pitie encline: No sooner did thy dear and onely Son Perceive thee purpos&amp;#39;d not to doom frail Man So strictly, but much more to pitie enclin&amp;#39;d, He to appease thy wrauth, and end the strife Of Mercy and justice in thy face discern&amp;#39;d, Regardless of the Bliss wherein hee sat Second to thee, offerd himself to die For mans offence. O unexampl&amp;#39;d love, Love no where to be found less then Divine! Hail Son of God, Saviour of Men, thy Name Shall be the copious matter of my Song Henceforth, and never shall my Harp thy praise Forget, nor from thy Fathers praise disjoine. Thus they in Heav&amp;#39;n, above the starry Sphear, Thir happie hours in joy and hymning spent. Mean while upon the firm opacous Globe Of this round World, whose first convex divides The luminous inferior Orbs, enclos&amp;#39;d From Chaos and th&amp;#39; inroad of Darkness old, Satan alighted walks: a Globe farr off It seem&amp;#39;d, now seems a boundless Continent Dark, waste, and wild, under the frown of Night Starless expos&amp;#39;d, and ever-threatning storms Of Chaos blustring round, inclement skie; Save on that side which from the wall of Heav&amp;#39;n Though distant farr som small reflection gaines Of glimmering air less vext with tempest loud: Here walk&amp;#39;d the Fiend at large in spacious field. As when a Vultur on Imaus bred, Whose snowie ridge the roving Tartar bounds, Dislodging from a Region scarce of prey To gorge the flesh of Lambs or yeanling Kids On Hills where Flocks are fed, flies toward the Springs Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams; But in his way lights on the barren Plaines Of Sericana, where Chineses drive With Sails and Wind thir canie Waggons light: So on this windie Sea of Land, the Fiend Walk&amp;#39;d up and down alone bent on his prey, Alone, for other Creature in this place Living or liveless to be found was none, None yet, but store hereafter from the earth Up hither like Aereal vapours flew Of all things transitorie and vain, when Sin With vanity had filld the works of men: Both all things vain, and all who in vain things Built thir fond hopes of Glorie or lasting fame, Or happiness in this or th&amp;#39; other life; All who have thir reward on Earth, the fruits Of painful Superstition and blind Zeal, Naught seeking but the praise of men, here find Fit retribution, emptie as thir deeds; All th, unaccomplisht works of Natures hand, Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixt, Dissolvd on Earth, fleet hither, and in vain, Till final dissolution, wander here, Not in the neighbouring Moon, as some have dreamd; Those argent Fields more likely habitants, Translated Saints, or middle Spirits hold Betwixt th&amp;#39; Angelical and Human kinde: Hither of ill-joynd Sons and Daughters born First from the ancient World those Giants came With many a vain exploit, though then renownd: The builders next of Babel on the Plain Of Sennaar, and still with vain designe New Babels, had they wherewithall, would build: Others came single; he who to be deemd A God, leap&amp;#39;d fondly into Aetna flames, Empedocles, and hee who to enjoy Plato&amp;#39;s Elysium, leap&amp;#39;d into the Sea, Cleombrotus, and many more too long, Embryo&amp;#39;s and Idiots, Eremits and Friers White, Black and Grey, with all thir trumperie. Here Pilgrims roam, that stray&amp;#39;d so farr to seek In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heav&amp;#39;n; And they who to be sure of Paradise Dying put on the weeds of Dominic, Or in Franciscan think to pass disguis&amp;#39;d; They pass the Planets seven, and pass the fixt, And that Crystalline Sphear whose ballance weighs The Trepidation talkt, and that first mov&amp;#39;d; And now Saint Peter at Heav&amp;#39;ns Wicket seems To wait them with his Keys, and now at foot Of Heav&amp;#39;ns ascent they lift thir Feet, when loe A violent cross wind from either Coast Blows them transverse ten thousand Leagues awry Into the devious Air; then might ye see Cowles, Hoods and Habits with thir wearers tost And flutterd into Raggs, then Reliques, Beads, Indulgences, Dispenses, Pardons, Bulls, The sport of Winds: all these upwhirld aloft Fly o&amp;#39;re the backside of the World farr off Into a Limbo large and broad, since calld The Paradise of Fools, to few unknown Long after, now unpeopl&amp;#39;d, and untrod; All this dark Globe the Fiend found as he pass&amp;#39;d, And long he wanderd, till at last a gleame Of dawning light turnd thither-ward in haste His travell&amp;#39;d steps; farr distant he descries Ascending by degrees magnificent Up to the wall of Heaven a Structure high, At top whereof, but farr more rich appeerd The work as of a Kingly Palace Gate With Frontispice of Diamond and Gold Imbellisht, thick with sparkling orient Gemmes The Portal shon, inimitable on Earth By Model, or by shading Pencil drawn. The Stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw Angels ascending and descending, bands Of Guardians bright, when he from Esau fled To Padan-Aram in the field of Luz, Dreaming by night under the open Skie, And waking cri&amp;#39;d, This is the Gate of Heav&amp;#39;n. Each Stair mysteriously was meant, nor stood There alwayes, but drawn up to Heav&amp;#39;n somtimes Viewless, and underneath a bright Sea flow&amp;#39;d Of Jasper, or of liquid Pearle, whereon Who after came from Earth, sayling arriv&amp;#39;d, Wafted by Angels, or flew o&amp;#39;re the Lake Rapt in a Chariot drawn by fiery Steeds. The Stairs were then let down, whether to dare The Fiend by easie ascent, or aggravate His sad exclusion from the dores of Bliss. Direct against which op&amp;#39;nd from beneath, Just o&amp;#39;re the blissful seat of Paradise, A passage down to th&amp;#39; Earth, a passage wide, Wider by farr then that of after-times Over Mount Sion, and, though that were large, Over the Promis&amp;#39;d Land to God so dear, By which, to visit oft those happy Tribes, On high behests his Angels to and fro Pass&amp;#39;d frequent, and his eye with choice regard From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood To Beersaba, where the Holy Land Borders on Aegypt and the Arabian shoare; So wide the op&amp;#39;ning seemd, where bounds were set To darkness, such as bound the Ocean wave. Satan from hence now on the lower stair That scal&amp;#39;d by steps of Gold to Heav&amp;#39;n Gate Looks down with wonder at the sudden view Of all this World at once. As when a Scout Through dark and desart wayes with peril gone All night; at last by break of chearful dawne Obtains the brow of some high-climbing Hill, Which to his eye discovers unaware The goodly prospect of some forein land First-seen, or some renown&amp;#39;d Metropolis With glistering Spires and Pinnacles adornd, Which now the Rising Sun guilds with his beams. Such wonder seis&amp;#39;d, though after Heaven seen, The Spirit maligne, but much more envy seis&amp;#39;d At sight of all this World beheld so faire. Round he surveys, and well might, where he stood So high above the circling Canopie Of Nights extended shade; from Eastern Point Of Libra to the fleecie Starr that bears Andromeda farr off Atlantic Seas Beyond th&amp;#39; Horizon; then from Pole to Pole He views in bredth, and without longer pause Down right into the Worlds first Region throws His flight precipitant, and windes with ease Through the pure marble Air his oblique way Amongst innumerable Starrs, that shon Stars distant, but nigh hand seemd other Worlds, Or other Worlds they seemd, or happy Iles, Like those Hesperian Gardens fam&amp;#39;d of old, Fortunate Fields, and Groves and flourie Vales, Thrice happy Iles, but who dwelt happy there He stayd not to enquire: above them all The golden Sun in splendor likest Heaven Allur&amp;#39;d his eye: Thither his course he bends Through the calm Firmament; but up or downe By center, or eccentric, hard to tell, Or Longitude, where the great Luminarie Alooff the vulgar Constellations thick, That from his Lordly eye keep distance due, Dispenses Light from farr; they as they move Thir Starry dance in numbers that compute Days, months, &amp;amp; years, towards his all-chearing Lamp Turn swift thir various motions, or are turnd By his Magnetic beam, that gently warms The Univers, and to each inward part With gentle penetration, though unseen, Shoots invisible vertue even to the deep: So wondrously was set his Station bright. There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps Astronomer in the Sun&amp;#39;s lucent Orbe Through his glaz&amp;#39;d Optic Tube yet never saw. The place he found beyond expression bright, Compar&amp;#39;d with aught on Earth, Medal or Stone; Not all parts like, but all alike informd With radiant light, as glowing Iron with fire; If mettal, part seemd Gold, part Silver cleer; If stone, Carbuncle most or Chrysolite, Rubie or Topaz, to the Twelve that shon In Aarons Brest-plate, and a stone besides Imagind rather oft then elsewhere seen, That stone, or like to that which here below Philosophers in vain so long have sought, In vain, though by thir powerful Art they binde Volatil Hermes, and call up unbound In various shapes old Proteus from the Sea, Draind through a Limbec to his Native forme. What wonder then if fields and regions here Breathe forth Elixir pure, and Rivers run Potable Gold, when with one vertuous touch Th&amp;#39; Arch-chimic Sun so farr from us remote Produces with Terrestrial Humor mixt Here in the dark so many precious things Of colour glorious and effect so rare? Here matter new to gaze the Devil met Undazl&amp;#39;d, farr and wide his eye commands, For sight no obstacle found here, nor shade, But all Sun-shine, as when his Beams at Noon Culminate from th&amp;#39; Aequator, as they now Shot upward still direct, whence no way round Shadow from body opaque can fall, and the Aire, No where so cleer, sharp&amp;#39;nd his visual ray To objects distant farr, whereby he soon Saw within kenn a glorious Angel stand, The same whom John saw also in the Sun: His back was turnd, but not his brightness hid; Of beaming sunnie Raies, a golden tiar Circl&amp;#39;d his Head, nor less his Locks behind Illustrious on his Shoulders fledge with wings Lay waving round; on som great charge imploy&amp;#39;d He seemd, or fixt in cogitation deep. Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope To find who might direct his wandring flight To Paradise the happie seat of Man, His journies end and our beginning woe. But first he casts to change his proper shape, Which else might work him danger or delay: And now a stripling Cherube he appeers, Not of the prime, yet such as in his face Youth smil&amp;#39;d Celestial, and to every Limb Sutable grace diffus&amp;#39;d, so well he feignd; Under a Coronet his flowing haire In curles on either cheek plaid, wings he wore Of many a colourd plume sprinkl&amp;#39;d with Gold, His habit fit for speed succinct, and held Before his decent steps a Silver wand. He drew not nigh unheard, the Angel bright, Ere he drew nigh, his radiant visage turnd, Admonisht by his ear, and strait was known Th&amp;#39; Arch-Angel Uriel, one of the seav&amp;#39;n Who in Gods presence, neerest to his Throne Stand ready at command, and are his Eyes That run through all the Heav&amp;#39;ns, or down to th&amp;#39; Earth Bear his swift errands over moist and dry, O&amp;#39;re Sea and Land: him Satan thus accostes; Uriel, for thou of those seav&amp;#39;n Spirits that stand In sight of God&amp;#39;s high Throne, gloriously bright, The first art wont his great authentic will Interpreter through highest Heav&amp;#39;n to bring, Where all his Sons thy Embassie attend; And here art likeliest by supream decree Like honour to obtain, and as his Eye To visit oft this new Creation round; Unspeakable desire to see, and know All these his wondrous works, but chiefly Man, His chief delight and favour, him for whom All these his works so wondrous he ordaind, Hath brought me from the Quires of Cherubim Alone thus wandring. Brightest Seraph tell In which of all these shining Orbes hath Man His fixed seat, or fixed seat hath none, But all these shining Orbes his choice to dwell; That I may find him, and with secret gaze, Or open admiration him behold On whom the great Creator hath bestowd Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces powrd; That both in him and all things, as is meet, The Universal Maker we may praise; Who justly hath drivn out his Rebell Foes To deepest Hell, and to repair that loss Created this new happie Race of Men To serve him better: wise are all his wayes. So spake the false dissembler unperceivd; For neither Man nor Angel can discern Hypocrisie, the onely evil that walks Invisible, except to God alone, By his permissive will, through Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth: And oft though wisdom wake, suspicion sleeps At wisdoms Gate, and to simplicitie Resigns her charge, while goodness thinks no ill Where no ill seems: Which now for once beguil&amp;#39;d Uriel, though Regent of the Sun, and held The sharpest sighted Spirit of all in Heav&amp;#39;n; Who to the fraudulent Impostor foule In his uprightness answer thus returnd. Fair Angel, thy desire which tends to know The works of God, thereby to glorifie The great Work-Maister, leads to no excess That reaches blame, but rather merits praise The more it seems excess, that led thee hither From thy Empyreal Mansion thus alone, To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps Contented with report hear onely in heav&amp;#39;n: For wonderful indeed are all his works, Pleasant to know, and worthiest to be all Had in remembrance alwayes with delight; But what created mind can comprehend Thir number, or the wisdom infinite That brought them forth, but hid thir causes deep. I saw when at his Word the formless Mass, This worlds material mould, came to a heap: Confusion heard his voice, and wilde uproar Stood rul&amp;#39;d, stood vast infinitude confin&amp;#39;d; Till at his second bidding darkness fled, Light shon, and order from disorder sprung: Swift to thir several Quarters hasted then The cumbrous Elements, Earth, Flood, Aire, Fire, And this Ethereal quintessence of Heav&amp;#39;n Flew upward, spirited with various forms, That rowld orbicular, and turnd to Starrs Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move; Each had his place appointed, each his course, The rest in circuit walles this Universe. Look downward on that Globe whose hither side With light from hence, though but reflected, shines; That place is Earth the seat of Man, that light His day, which else as th&amp;#39; other Hemisphere Night would invade, but there the neighbouring Moon (So call that opposite fair Starr) her aide Timely interposes, and her monthly round Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heav&amp;#39;n; With borrowd light her countenance triform Hence fills and empties to enlighten th&amp;#39; Earth, And in her pale dominion checks the night. That spot to which I point is Paradise, Adams abode, those loftie shades his Bowre. Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires. Thus said, he turnd, and Satan bowing low, As to superior Spirits is wont in Heaven, Where honour due and reverence none neglects, Took leave, and toward the coast of Earth beneath, Down from th&amp;#39; Ecliptic, sped with hop&amp;#39;d success, Throws his steep flight in many an Aerie wheele, Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;O For that warning voice, which he who saw Th&amp;#39; Apocalyps, heard cry in Heaven aloud, Then when the Dragon, put to second rout, Came furious down to be reveng&amp;#39;d on men, Wo to the inhabitants on Earth! that now, While time was, our first-Parents had bin warnd The coming of thir secret foe, and scap&amp;#39;d Haply so scap&amp;#39;d his mortal snare; for now Satan, now first inflam&amp;#39;d with rage, came down, The Tempter ere th&amp;#39; Accuser of man-kind, To wreck on innocent frail man his loss Of that first Battel, and his flight to Hell: Yet not rejoycing in his speed, though bold, Far off and fearless, nor with cause to boast, Begins his dire attempt, which nigh the birth Now rowling, boiles in his tumultuous brest, And like a devillish Engine back recoiles Upon himself; horror and doubt distract His troubl&amp;#39;d thoughts, and from the bottom stirr The Hell within him, for within him Hell He brings, and round about him, nor from Hell One step no more then from himself can fly By change of place: Now conscience wakes despair That slumberd, wakes the bitter memorie Of what he was, what is, and what must be Worse; of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue. Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view Lay pleasant, his grievd look he fixes sad, Sometimes towards Heav&amp;#39;n and the full-blazing Sun, Which now sat high in his Meridian Towre: Then much revolving, thus in sighs began. O thou that with surpassing Glory crownd, Look&amp;#39;st from thy sole Dominion like the God Of this new World; at whose sight all the Starrs Hide thir diminisht heads; to thee I call, But with no friendly voice, and add thy name O Sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams That bring to my remembrance from what state I fell, how glorious once above thy Spheare; Till Pride and worse Ambition threw me down Warring in Heav&amp;#39;n against Heav&amp;#39;ns matchless King: Ah wherefore! he deservd no such return From me, whom he created what I was In that bright eminence, and with his good Upbraided none; nor was his service hard. What could be less then to afford him praise, The easiest recompence, and pay him thanks, How due! yet all his good prov&amp;#39;d ill in me, And wrought but malice; lifted up so high I sdeind subjection, and thought one step higher Would set me highest, and in a moment quit The debt immense of endless gratitude, So burthensome still paying, still to ow; Forgetful what from him I still receivd, And understood not that a grateful mind By owing owes not, but still pays, at once Indebted and dischargd; what burden then? O had his powerful Destiny ordaind Me some inferiour Angel, I had stood Then happie; no unbounded hope had rais&amp;#39;d Ambition. Yet why not? som other Power As great might have aspir&amp;#39;d, and me though mean Drawn to his part; but other Powers as great Fell not, but stand unshak&amp;#39;n, from within Or from without, to all temptations arm&amp;#39;d. Hadst thou the same free Will and Power to stand? Thou hadst: whom hast thou then or what to accuse, But Heav&amp;#39;ns free Love dealt equally to all? Be then his Love accurst, since love or hate, To me alike, it deals eternal woe. Nay curs&amp;#39;d be thou; since against his thy will Chose freely what it now so justly rues. Me miserable! which way shall I flie Infinite wrauth, and infinite despaire? Which way I flie is Hell; my self am Hell; And in the lowest deep a lower deep Still threatning to devour me opens wide, To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heav&amp;#39;n. O then at last relent: is there no place Left for Repentance, none for Pardon left? None left but by submission; and that word Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc&amp;#39;d With other promises and other vaunts Then to submit, boasting I could subdue Th&amp;#39; Omnipotent. Ay me, they little know How dearly I abide that boast so vaine, Under what torments inwardly I groane; While they adore me on the Throne of Hell, With Diadem and Scepter high advanc&amp;#39;d The lower still I fall, onely Supream In miserie; such joy Ambition findes. But say I could repent and could obtaine By Act of Grace my former state; how soon Would higth recal high thoughts, how soon unsay What feign&amp;#39;d submission swore: ease would recant Vows made in pain, as violent and void. For never can true reconcilement grow Where wounds of deadly hate have peirc&amp;#39;d so deep: Which would but lead me to a worse relapse And heavier fall: so should I purchase deare Short intermission bought with double smart. This knows my punisher; therefore as farr From granting hee, as I from begging peace: All hope excluded thus, behold in stead Of us out-cast, exil&amp;#39;d, his new delight, Mankind created, and for him this World. So farwel Hope, and with Hope farwel Fear, Farwel Remorse: all Good to me is lost; Evil be thou my Good; by thee at least Divided Empire with Heav&amp;#39;ns King I hold By thee, and more then half perhaps will reigne; As Man ere long, and this new World shall know. Thus while he spake, each passion dimm&amp;#39;d his face Thrice chang&amp;#39;d with pale, ire, envie and despair, Which marrd his borrow&amp;#39;d visage, and betraid Him counterfet, if any eye beheld. For heav&amp;#39;nly mindes from such distempers foule Are ever cleer. Whereof hee soon aware, Each perturbation smooth&amp;#39;d with outward calme, Artificer of fraud; and was the first That practisd falshood under saintly shew, Deep malice to conceale, couch&amp;#39;t with revenge: Yet not anough had practisd to deceive Uriel once warnd; whose eye pursu&amp;#39;d him down The way he went, and on th&amp;#39; Assyrian mount Saw him disfigur&amp;#39;d, more then could befall Spirit of happie sort: his gestures fierce He markd and mad demeanour, then alone, As he suppos&amp;#39;d, all unobserv&amp;#39;d, unseen. So on he fares, and to the border comes, Of Eden, where delicious Paradise, Now nearer, Crowns with her enclosure green, As with a rural mound the champain head Of a steep wilderness, whose hairie sides With thicket overgrown, grottesque and wilde, Access deni&amp;#39;d; and over head up grew Insuperable highth of loftiest shade, Cedar, and Pine, and Firr, and branching Palm, A Silvan Scene, and as the ranks ascend Shade above shade, a woodie Theatre Of stateliest view. Yet higher then thir tops The verdurous wall of paradise up sprung: Which to our general Sire gave prospect large Into his neather Empire neighbouring round. And higher then that Wall a circling row Of goodliest Trees loaden with fairest Fruit, Blossoms and Fruits at once of golden hue Appeerd, with gay enameld colours mixt: On which the Sun more glad impress&amp;#39;d his beams Then in fair Evening Cloud, or humid Bow, When God hath showrd the earth; so lovely seemd That Lantskip: And of pure now purer aire Meets his approach, and to the heart inspires Vernal delight and joy, able to drive All sadness but despair: now gentle gales Fanning thir odoriferous wings dispense Native perfumes, and whisper whence they stole Those balmie spoiles. As when to them who saile Beyond the Cape of Hope, and now are past Mozambic, off at Sea North-East windes blow Sabean Odours from the spicie shoare Of Arabie the blest, with such delay Well pleas&amp;#39;d they slack thir course, and many a League Chear&amp;#39;d with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles. So entertaind those odorous sweets the Fiend Who came thir bane, though with them better pleas&amp;#39;d Then Asmodeus with the fishie fume, That drove him, though enamourd, from the Spouse Of Tobits Son, and with a vengeance sent From Media post to Aegypt, there fast bound. Now to th&amp;#39; ascent of that steep savage Hill Satan had journied on, pensive and slow; But further way found none, so thick entwin&amp;#39;d, As one continu&amp;#39;d brake, the undergrowth Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplext All path of Man or Beast that past that way: One Gate there only was, and that look&amp;#39;d East On th&amp;#39; other side: which when th&amp;#39; arch-fellon saw Due entrance he disdaind, and in contempt, At one slight bound high over leap&amp;#39;d all bound Of Hill or highest Wall, and sheer within Lights on his feet. As when a prowling Wolfe, Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey, Watching where Shepherds pen thir Flocks at eeve In hurdl&amp;#39;d Cotes amid the field secure, Leaps o&amp;#39;re the fence with ease into the Fould:. Or as a Thief bent to unhoord the cash Of some rich Burgher, whose substantial dores, Cross-barrd and bolted fast, fear no assault, In at the window climbs, or o&amp;#39;re the tiles; So clomb this first grand Thief into Gods Fould: So since into his Church lewd Hirelings climbe. Thence up he flew, and on the Tree of Life, The middle Tree and highest there that grew, Sat like a Cormorant; yet not true Life Thereby regaind, but sat devising Death To them who liv&amp;#39;d; nor on the vertue thought Of that life-giving Plant, but only us&amp;#39;d For prospect, what well us&amp;#39;d had bin the pledge Of immortality. So little knows Any, but God alone, to value right The good before him, but perverts best things To worst abuse, or to thir meanest use. Beneath him with new wonder now he views To all delight of human sense expos&amp;#39;d In narrow room Natures whole wealth, yea more, A Heav&amp;#39;n on Earth, for blissful Paradise Of God the Garden was, by him in the East Of Eden planted; Eden stretchd her Line From Auran Eastward to the Royal Towrs Of great Seleucia, built by Grecian Kings, Or where the Sons of Eden long before Dwelt in Telassar: in this pleasant soile His farr more pleasant Garden God ordaind; Out of the fertil ground he caus&amp;#39;d to grow All Trees of noblest kind for sight, smell, taste; And all amid them stood the Tree of Life, High eminent, blooming Ambrosial Fruit Of vegetable Gold; and next to Life Our Death the Tree of knowledge grew fast by, Knowledge of Good bought dear by knowing ill. Southward through Eden went a River large, Nor chang&amp;#39;d his course, but through the shaggie hill Pass&amp;#39;d underneath ingulft, for God had thrown That Mountain as his Garden mould high rais&amp;#39;d Upon the rapid current, which through veins Of porous Earth with kindly thirst up drawn, Rose a fresh Fountain, and with many a rill Waterd the Garden; thence united fell Down the steep glade, and met the neather Flood, Which from his darksom passage now appeers, And now divided into four main Streams, Runs divers, wandring many a famous Realme And Country whereof here needs no account, But rather to tell how, if Art could tell, How from that Saphire Fount the crisped Brooks, Rowling on Orient Pearl and sands of Gold, With mazie error under pendant shades Ran Nectar, visiting each plant, and fed Flours worthy of Paradise which not nice Art In Beds and curious Knots, but Nature boon Powrd forth profuse on Hill and Dale and Plaine, Both where the morning Sun first warmly smote The open field, and where the unpierc&amp;#39;t shade lmbround the noontide Bowrs: Thus was this place, A happy rural seat of various view; Groves whose rich Trees wept odorous Gumms and Balme, Others whose fruit burnisht with Golden Rinde Hung amiable, Hesperian Fables true, If true, here only, and of delicious taste: Betwixt them Lawns, or level Downs, and Flocks Grasing the tender herb, were interpos&amp;#39;d, Or palmie hilloc, or the flourie lap Of som irriguous Valley spred her store, Flours of all hue, and without Thorn the Rose: Another side, umbrageous Grots and Caves Of coole recess, o&amp;#39;re which the mantling vine Layes forth her purple Grape, and gently creeps Luxuriant; mean while murmuring waters fall Down the slope hills, disperst, or in a Lake, That to the fringed Bank with Myrtle crownd, Her chrystal mirror holds, unite thir streams. The Birds thir quire apply; aires, vernal aires, Breathing the smell of field and grove, attune The trembling leaves, while Universal Pan Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance Led on th&amp;#39; Eternal Spring. Not that faire field Of Enna, where Proserpin gathering flours Her self a fairer Floure by gloomie Dis Was gatherd, which cost Ceres all that pain To seek her through the world; nor that sweet Grove Of Daphne by Orontes, and th&amp;#39; inspir&amp;#39;d Castalian Spring, might with this Paradise Of Eden strive; nor that Nyseian Ile Girt with the River Triton, where old Cham, Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Lybian Jove, Hid Amalthea and her Florid Son Young Bacchus from his Stepdame Rhea&amp;#39;s eye; Nor where Abassin Kings thir issue Guard, Mount Amara, though this by som suppos&amp;#39;d True Paradise under the Ethiop Line By Nilus head, enclosd with shining Rock, A whole days journy high, but wide remote From this Assyrian Garden, where the Fiend Saw undelighted all delight, all kind Of living Creatures new to sight and strange: Two of far nobler shape erect and tall, Godlike erect, with native Honour clad In naked Majestie seemd Lords of all, And worthie seemd, for in thir looks Divine The image of thir glorious Maker shon, Truth, wisdome, Sanctitude severe and pure, Severe but in true filial freedom plac&amp;#39;t; Whence true autoritie in men; though both Not equal, as thir sex not equal seemd; For contemplation hee and valour formd, For softness shee and sweet attractive Grace, Hee for God only, shee for God in him: His fair large Front and Eye sublime declar&amp;#39;d Absolute rule; and Hyacinthin Locks Round from his parted forelock manly hung Clustring, but not beneath his shoulders broad: Shee as a vail down to the slender waste Her unadorned golden tresses wore Dissheveld, but in wanton ringlets wav&amp;#39;d As the Vine curles her tendrils, which impli&amp;#39;d Subjection, but requir&amp;#39;d with gentle sway, And by her yielded, by him best receivd, Yielded with coy submission, modest pride, And sweet reluctant amorous delay. Nor those mysterious parts were then conceald, Then was not guiltie shame, dishonest shame Of natures works, honor dishonorable, Sin-bred, how have ye troubl&amp;#39;d all mankind With shews instead, meer shews of seeming pure, And banisht from mans life his happiest life, Simplicitie and spotless innocence. So passd they naked on, nor shund the sight Of God or Angel, for they thought no ill: So hand in hand they passd, the lovliest pair That ever since in loves imbraces met, Adam the goodliest man of men since borne His Sons, the fairest of her Daughters Eve. Under a tuft of shade that on a green Stood whispering soft, by a fresh Fountain side They sat them down, and after no more toil Of thir sweet Gardning labour then suffic&amp;#39;d To recommend coole Zephyr, and made ease More easie, wholsom thirst and appetite More grateful, to thir Supper Fruits they fell, Nectarine Fruits which the compliant boughes Yielded them, side-long as they sat recline On the soft downie Bank damaskt with flours: The savourie pulp they chew, and in the rinde Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream; Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles Wanted, nor youthful dalliance as beseems Fair couple, linkt in happie nuptial League, Alone as they. About them frisking playd All Beasts of th&amp;#39; Earth, since wilde, and of all chase In Wood or Wilderness, Forrest or Den; Sporting the Lion rampd, and in his paw Dandl&amp;#39;d the Kid; Bears, Tygers, Ounces, Pards, Gambold before them, th&amp;#39; unwieldy Elephant To make them mirth us&amp;#39;d all his might, and wreathd His Lithe Proboscis; close the Serpent sly Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine His breaded train, and of his fatal guile Gave proof unheeded; others on the grass Coucht, and now fild with pasture gazing sat, Or Bedward ruminating: for the Sun Declin&amp;#39;d was hasting now with prone carreer To th&amp;#39; Ocean Iles, and in th&amp;#39; ascending Scale Of Heav&amp;#39;n the Starrs that usher Evening rose: When Satan still in gaze, as first he stood, Scarce thus at length faild speech recoverd sad. O Hell! what doe mine eyes with grief behold, Into our room of bliss thus high advanc&amp;#39;t Creatures of other mould, earth-born perhaps, Not Spirits, yet to heav&amp;#39;nly Spirits bright Little inferior; whom my thoughts pursue With wonder, and could love, so lively shines In them Divine resemblance, and such grace The hand that formd them on thir shape hath pourd. Ah gentle pair, yee little think how nigh Your change approaches, when all these delights Will vanish and deliver ye to woe, More woe, the more your taste is now of joy; Happie, but for so happie ill secur&amp;#39;d Long to continue, and this high seat your Heav&amp;#39;n Ill fenc&amp;#39;t for Heav&amp;#39;n to keep out such a foe As now is enterd; yet no purpos&amp;#39;d foe To you whom I could pittie thus forlorne Though I unpittied: League with you I seek, And mutual amitie so streight, so close, That I with you must dwell, or you with me Henceforth; my dwelling haply may not please Like this fair Paradise, your sense, yet such Accept your Makers work; he gave it me, Which I as freely give; Hell shall unfold, To entertain you two, her widest Gates, And send forth all her Kings; there will be room, Not like these narrow limits, to receive ass Your numerous ofspring; if no better place, Thank him who puts me loath to this revenge On you who wrong me not for him who wrongd. And should I at your harmless innocence Melt, as I doe, yet public reason just, Honour and Empire with revenge enlarg&amp;#39;d, By conquering this new World, compels me now To do what else though damnd I should abhorre. So spake the Fiend, and with necessitie, The Tyrants plea, excus&amp;#39;d his devilish deeds. Then from his loftie stand on that high Tree Down he alights among the sportful Herd Of those fourfooted kindes, himself now one, Now other, as thir shape servd best his end Neerer to view his prey, and unespi&amp;#39;d To mark what of thir state he more might learn By word or action markt: about them round A Lion now he stalkes with fierie glare, Then as a Tyger, who by chance hath spi&amp;#39;d In some Purlieu two gentle Fawnes at play, Strait couches close, then rising changes oft His couchant watch, as one who chose his ground Whence rushing he might surest seize them both Grip&amp;#39;t in each paw: When Adam first of men To first of women Eve thus moving speech, Turnd him all eare to hear new utterance flow. Sole partner and sole part of all these joyes, Dearer thy self then all; needs must the power That made us, and for us this ample World Be infinitly good, and of his good As liberal and free as infinite, That rais&amp;#39;d us from the dust and plac&amp;#39;t us here In all this happiness, who at his hand Have nothing merited, nor can performe Aught whereof hee hath need, hee who requires From us no other service then to keep This one, this easie charge, of all the Trees In Paradise that bear delicious fruit So various, not to taste that onely Tree Of knowledge, planted by the Tree of Life, So neer grows Death to Life, what ere Death is, Som dreadful thing no doubt; for well thou knowst God hath pronounc&amp;#39;t it death to taste that Tree, The only sign of our obedience left Among so many signes of power and rule Conferrd upon us, and Dominion giv&amp;#39;n Over all other Creatures that possess Earth, Aire, and Sea. Then let us not think hard One easie prohibition, who enjoy Free leave so large to all things else, and choice Unlimited of manifold delights: But let us ever praise him, and extoll His bountie, following our delightful task To prune these growing Plants, and tend these Flours, Which were it toilsom, yet with thee were sweet. To whom thus Eve repli&amp;#39;d. O thou for whom And from whom I was formd flesh of thy flesh, And without whom am to no end, my Guide And Head, what thou hast said is just and right. For wee to him indeed all praises owe, And daily thanks, I chiefly who enjoy So farr the happier Lot, enjoying thee Praeeminent by so much odds, while thou Like consort to thy self canst no where find. That day I oft remember, when from sleep I first awak&amp;#39;t, and found my self repos&amp;#39;d Under a shade of flours, much wondring where And what I was, whence thither brought, and how. Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound Of waters issu&amp;#39;d from a Cave and spread Into a liquid Plain, then stood unmov&amp;#39;d Pure as th&amp;#39; expanse of Heav&amp;#39;n; I thither went With unexperienc&amp;#39;t thought, and laid me downe On the green bank, to look into the cleer Smooth Lake, that to me seemd another Skie. As I bent down to look, just opposite, A Shape within the watry gleam appeerd Bending to look on me, I started back, It started back, but pleas&amp;#39;d I soon returnd, Pleas&amp;#39;d it returnd as soon with answering looks Of sympathie and love; there I had fixt Mine eyes till now, and pin&amp;#39;d with vain desire, Had not a voice thus warnd me, What thou seest, What there thou seest fair Creature is thy self, With thee it came and goes: but follow me, And I will bring thee where no shadow staies Thy coming, and thy soft imbraces, hee Whose image thou art, him thou shall enjoy Inseparablie thine, to him shalt beare Multitudes like thy self, and thence be call&amp;#39;d Mother of human Race: what could I doe, But follow strait, invisibly thus led? Till I espi&amp;#39;d thee, fair indeed and tall, Under a Platan, yet methought less faire, Less winning soft, less amiablie milde, Then that smooth watry image; back I turnd, Thou following cryd&amp;#39;st aloud, Return faire Eve, Whom fli&amp;#39;st thou? whom thou fli&amp;#39;st, of him thou art, His flesh, his bone; to give thee being I lent Out of my side to thee, neerest my heart Substantial Life, to have thee by my side Henceforth an individual solace dear; Part of my Soul I seek thee, and thee claim My other half: with that thy gentle hand Seisd mine, I yielded, and from that time see How beauty is excelld by manly grace And wisdom, which alone is truly fair. So spake our general Mother, and with eyes Of conjugal attraction unreprov&amp;#39;d, And meek surrender, half imbracing leand On our first Father, half her swelling Breast Naked met his under the flowing Gold Of her loose tresses hid: he in delight Both of her Beauty and submissive Charms Smil&amp;#39;d with superior Love, as Jupiter On Juno smiles, when he impregns the Clouds That shed May Flowers; and press&amp;#39;d her Matron lip With kisses pure: aside the Devil turnd For envie, yet with jealous leer maligne Ey&amp;#39;d them askance, and to himself thus plaind. Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two Imparadis&amp;#39;t in one anothers arms The happier Eden, shall enjoy thir fill Of bliss on bliss, while I to Hell am thrust, Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire, Among our other torments not the least, Still unfulfill&amp;#39;d with pain of longing pines; Yet let me not forget what I have gain&amp;#39;d From thir own mouths; all is not theirs it seems: One fatal Tree there stands of Knowledge call&amp;#39;d, Forbidden them to taste: Knowledge forbidd&amp;#39;n? Suspicious, reasonless. Why should thir Lord Envie them that? can it be sin to know, Can it be death? and do they onely stand By Ignorance, is that thir happie state, The proof of thir obedience and thir faith? O fair foundation laid whereon to build Thir ruine! Hence I will excite thir minds With more desire to know, and to reject Envious commands, invented with designe To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt Equal with Gods; aspiring to be such, They taste and die: what likelier can ensue? But first with narrow search I must walk round This Garden, and no corner leave unspi&amp;#39;d; A chance but chance may lead where I may meet Some wandring Spirit of Heav&amp;#39;n, by Fountain side, Or in thick shade retir&amp;#39;d, from him to draw What further would be learnt. Live while ye may, Yet happie pair; enjoy, till I return, Short pleasures, for long woes are to succeed. So saying, his proud step he scornful turn&amp;#39;d, But with sly circumspection, and began Through wood, through waste, o&amp;#39;re hill, o&amp;#39;re dale his roam. Mean while in utmost Longitude, where Heav&amp;#39;n With Earth and Ocean meets, the setting Sun Slowly descended, and with right aspect Against the eastern Gate of Paradise Leveld his eevning Rayes: it was a Rock Of Alablaster, pil&amp;#39;d up to the Clouds, Conspicuous farr, winding with one ascent Accessible from Earth, one entrance high; The rest was craggie cliff, that overhung Still as it rose, impossible to climbe. Betwixt these rockie Pillars Gabriel sat Chief of th&amp;#39; Angelic Guards, awaiting night; About him exercis&amp;#39;d Heroic Games Th&amp;#39; unarmed Youth of Heav&amp;#39;n, but nigh at hand Celestial Armourie, Shields, Helmes, and Speares, Hung high with Diamond flaming, and with Gold. Thither came Uriel, gliding through the Eeven On a Sun beam, swift as a shooting Starr In Autumn thwarts the night, when vapors fir&amp;#39;d Impress the Air, and shews the Mariner From what point of his Compass to beware Impetuous winds: he thus began in haste. Gabriel, to thee thy course by Lot hath giv&amp;#39;n Charge and strict watch that to this happie Place No evil thing approach or enter in; This day at highth of Noon came to my Spheare A Spirit, zealous, as he seem&amp;#39;d, to know More of th&amp;#39; Almighties works, and chiefly Man Gods latest Image: I describ&amp;#39;d his way Bent all on speed, and markt his Aerie Gate; But in the Mount that lies from Eden North, Where he first lighted, soon discernd his looks Alien from Heav&amp;#39;n, with passions foul obscur&amp;#39;d: Mine eye pursu&amp;#39;d him still, but under shade Lost sight of him; one of the banisht crew I fear, hath ventur&amp;#39;d from the deep, to raise New troubles; him thy care must be to find. To whom the winged Warriour thus returnd: Uriel, no wonder if thy perfet sight, Amid the Suns bright circle where thou sitst, See farr and wide: in at this Gate none pass The vigilance here plac&amp;#39;t, but such as come Well known from Heav&amp;#39;n; and since Meridian hour No Creature thence: if Spirit of other sort, So minded, have oreleapt these earthie bounds On purpose, hard thou knowst it to exclude Spiritual substance with corporeal barr. But if within the circuit of these walks, In whatsoever shape he lurk, of whom Thou tellst, by morrow dawning I shall know. So promis&amp;#39;d hee, and Uriel to his charge Returnd on that bright beam, whose point now raisd Bore him slope downward to the Sun now fall&amp;#39;n Beneath th&amp;#39; Azores; whither the prime Orb, Incredible how swift, had thither rowl&amp;#39;d Diurnal, or this less volubil Earth By shorter flight to th&amp;#39; East, had left him there Arraying with reflected Purple and Gold The Clouds that on his Western Throne attend: Now came still Eevning on, and Twilight gray Had in her sober Liverie all things clad; Silence accompanied, for Beast and Bird, They to thir grassie Couch, these to thir Nests Were slunk, all but the wakeful Nightingale; She all night long her amorous descant sung; Silence was pleas&amp;#39;d: now glow&amp;#39;d the Firmament With living Saphirs: Hesperus that led The starrie Host, rode brightest, till the Moon Rising in clouded Majestie, at length Apparent Queen unvaild her peerless light, And o&amp;#39;re the dark her Silver Mantle threw. When Adam thus to Eve: Fair Consort, th&amp;#39; hour Of night, and all things now retir&amp;#39;d to rest Mind us of like repose, since God hath set Labour and rest, as day and night to men Successive, and the timely dew of sleep Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines Our eye-lids; other Creatures all day long Rove idle unimploid, and less need rest; Man hath his daily work of body or mind Appointed, which declares his Dignitie, And the regard of Heav&amp;#39;n on all his waies; While other Animals unactive range, And of thir doings God takes no account. To morrow ere fresh Morning streak the East With first approach of light, we must be ris&amp;#39;n, And at our pleasant labour, to reform Yon flourie Arbors, yonder Allies green, Our walk at noon, with branches overgrown, That mock our scant manuring, and require More hands then ours to lop thir wanton growth: Those Blossoms also, and those dropping Gumms, That lie bestrowne unsightly and unsmooth, Ask riddance, if we mean to tread with ease; Mean while, as Nature wills, Night bids us rest. To whom thus Eve with perfet beauty adornd. My Author and Disposer, what thou bidst Unargu&amp;#39;d I obey; so God ordains, God is thy Law, thou mine: to know no more Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise. With thee conversing I forget all time, All seasons and thir change, all please alike. Sweet is the breath of morn, her rising sweet, With charm of earliest Birds; pleasant the Sun When first on this delightful Land he spreads His orient Beams, on herb, tree, fruit, and flour, Glistring with dew; fragrant the fertil earth After soft showers; and sweet the coming on Of grateful Eevning milde, then silent Night With this her solemn Bird and this fair Moon, And these the Gemms of Heav&amp;#39;n, her starrie train: But neither breath of Morn when she ascends With charm of earliest Birds, nor rising Sun On this delightful land, nor herb, fruit, floure, Glistring with dew, nor fragrance after showers, Nor grateful Eevning mild, nor silent Night With this her solemn Bird, nor walk by Moon, Or glittering Starr-light without thee is sweet. But wherfore all night long shine these, for whom This glorious sight, when sleep hath shut all eyes? To whom our general Ancestor repli&amp;#39;d. Daughter of God and Man, accomplisht Eve, Those have thir course to finish, round the Earth, By morrow Eevning, and from Land to Land In order, though to Nations yet unborn, Ministring light prepar&amp;#39;d, they set and rise; Least total darkness should by Night regaine Her old possession, and extinguish life In Nature and all things, which these soft fires Not only enlighten, but with kindly heate Of various influence foment and warme, Temper or nourish, or in part shed down Thir stellar vertue on all kinds that grow On Earth, made hereby apter to receive Perfection from the Suns more potent Ray. These then, though unbeheld in deep of night, Shine not in vain, nor think, though men were none, That heav&amp;#39;n would want spectators, God want praise; Millions of spiritual Creatures walk the Earth Unseen, both when we wake, and when we sleep:. All these with ceasless praise his works behold Both day and night: how often from the steep Of echoing Hill or Thicket have we heard Celestial voices to the midnight air, Sole, or responsive each to others note Singing thir great Creator: oft in bands While they keep watch, or nightly rounding walk With Heav&amp;#39;nly touch of instrumental sounds In full harmonic number joind, thir songs Divide the night, and lift our thoughts to Heaven. Thus talking hand in hand alone they pass&amp;#39;d On to thir blissful Bower; it was a place Chos&amp;#39;n by the sovran Planter, when he fram&amp;#39;d All things to mans delightful use; the roofe Of thickest covert was inwoven shade Laurel and Mirtle, and what higher grew Of firm and fragrant leaf; on either side Acanthus, and each odorous bushie shrub Fenc&amp;#39;d up the verdant wall; each beauteous flour, Iris all hues, Roses, and Gessamin Rear&amp;#39;d high thir flourisht heads between, and wrought Mosaic; underfoot the Violet, Crocus, and Hyacinth with rich inlay Broiderd the ground, more colour&amp;#39;d then with stone Of costliest Emblem: other Creature here Beast, Bird, Insect, or Worm durst enter none; Such was thir awe of Man. In shadie Bower More sacred and sequesterd, though but feignd, Pan or Silvanus never slept, nor Nymph, Nor Faunus haunted. Here in close recess With Flowers, Garlands, and sweet-smelling Herbs Espoused Eve deckt first her nuptial Bed, And heav&amp;#39;nly Quires the Hymenaean sung, What day the genial Angel to our Sire Brought her in naked beauty more adorn&amp;#39;d, More lovely then Pandora, whom the Gods Endowd with all thir gifts, and O too like In sad event, when to the unwiser Son Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she ensnar&amp;#39;d Mankind with her faire looks, to be aveng&amp;#39;d On him who had stole Joves authentic fire. Thus at thir shadie Lodge arriv&amp;#39;d, both stood Both turnd, and under op&amp;#39;n Skie ador&amp;#39;d The God that made both Skie, Air, Earth and Heav&amp;#39;n Which they beheld, the Moons resplendent Globe And starrie Pole: Thou also mad&amp;#39;st the Night, Maker Omnipotent, and thou the Day, Which we in our appointed work imployd Have finisht happie in our mutual help And mutual love, the Crown of all our bliss Ordaind by thee, and this delicious place For us too large, where thy abundance wants Partakers, and uncropt falls to the ground. But thou hast promis&amp;#39;d from us two a Race To fill the Earth, who shall with us extoll Thy goodness infinite, both when we wake, And when we seek, as now, thy gift of sleep. This said unanimous, and other Rites Observing none, but adoration pure Which God likes best, into thir inmost bowre Handed they went; and eas&amp;#39;d the putting off These troublesom disguises which wee wear, Strait side by side were laid, nor turnd I weene Adam from his fair Spouse, nor Eve the Rites Mysterious of connubial Love refus&amp;#39;d: Whatever Hypocrites austerely talk Of puritie and place and innocence, Defaming as impure what God declares Pure, and commands to som, leaves free to all. Our Maker bids increase, who bids abstain But our destroyer, foe to God and Man? Haile wedded Love, mysterious Law, true source Of human ofspring, sole proprietie, In Paradise of all things common else. By thee adulterous lust was driv&amp;#39;n from men Among the bestial herds to raunge, by thee Founded in Reason, Loyal, just, and Pure, Relations dear, and all the Charities Of Father, Son, and Brother first were known. Farr be it, that I should write thee sin or blame, Or think thee unbefitting holiest place, Perpetual Fountain of Domestic sweets, Whose bed is undefil&amp;#39;d and chaste pronounc&amp;#39;t, Present, or past, as Saints and Patriarchs us&amp;#39;d. Here Love his golden shafts imploies, here lights His constant Lamp, and waves his purple wings, Reigns here and revels; not in the bought smile Of Harlots, loveless, joyless, unindeard, Casual fruition, nor in Court Amours Mixt Dance, or wanton Mask, or Midnight Bal, Or Serenate, which the starv&amp;#39;d Lover sings To his proud fair, best quitted with disdain. These lulld by Nightingales imbraceing slept, And on thir naked limbs the flourie roof Showrd Roses, which the Morn repair&amp;#39;d. Sleep on Blest pair; and O yet happiest if ye seek No happier state, and know to know no more. Now had night measur&amp;#39;d with her shaddowie Cone Half way up Hill this vast Sublunar Vault, And from thir Ivorie Port the Cherubim Forth issuing at th&amp;#39; accustomd hour stood armd To thir night watches in warlike Parade, When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake. Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the South With strictest watch; these other wheel the North, Our circuit meets full West. As flame they part Half wheeling to the Shield, half to the Spear. From these, two strong and suttle Spirits he calld That neer him stood, and gave them thus in charge. Ithuriel and Zephon, with wingd speed Search through this Garden, leave unsearcht no nook, But chiefly where those two fair Creatures Lodge, Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harme. This Eevning from the Sun&amp;#39;s decline arriv&amp;#39;d Who tells of som infernal Spirit seen Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escap&amp;#39;d The barrs of Hell, on errand bad no doubt: Such where ye find, seise fast, and hither bring. So saying, on he led his radiant Files, Daz&amp;#39;ling the Moon; these to the Bower direct In search of whom they sought: him there they found Squat like a Toad, close at the eare of Eve; Assaying by his Devilish art to reach The Organs of her Fancie, and with them forge Illusions as he list, Phantasms and Dreams, Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint Th&amp;#39; animal Spirits that from pure blood arise Like gentle breaths from Rivers pure, thence raise At least distemperd, discontented thoughts, Vaine hopes, vaine aimes, inordinate desires Blown up with high conceits ingendring pride. Him thus intent Ithuriel with his Spear Touch&amp;#39;d lightly; for no falshood can endure Touch of Celestial temper, but returns Of force to its own likeness: up he starts Discoverd and surpriz&amp;#39;d. As when a spark Lights on a heap of nitrous Powder, laid Fit for the Tun som Magazin to store Against a rumord Warr, the Smuttie graine With sudden blaze diffus&amp;#39;d, inflames the Aire: So started up in his own shape the Fiend. Back stept those two faire Angels half amaz&amp;#39;d So sudden to behold the grieslie King; Yet thus, unmovd with fear, accost him soon. Which of those rebell Spirits adjudg&amp;#39;d to Hell Com&amp;#39;st thou, escap&amp;#39;d thy prison, and transform&amp;#39;d, Why satst thou like an enemie in waite Here watching at the head of these that sleep? Know ye not then said Satan, fill&amp;#39;d with scorn, Know ye not mee? ye knew me once no mate For you, there sitting where ye durst not soare; Not to know mee argues your selves unknown, The lowest of your throng; or if ye know, Why ask ye, and superfluous begin Your message, like to end as much in vain? To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn. Think not, revolted Spirit, thy shape the same, Or undiminisht brightness, to be known As when thou stoodst in Heav&amp;#39;n upright and pure; That Glorie then, when thou no more wast good, Departed from thee, and thou resembl&amp;#39;st now Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foule. But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep This place inviolable, and these from harm. So spake the Cherube, and his grave rebuke Severe in youthful beautie, added grace Invincible: abasht the Devil stood, And felt how awful goodness is, and saw Vertue in her shape how lovly, saw, and pin&amp;#39;d His loss; but chiefly to find here observd His lustre visibly impar&amp;#39;d; yet seemd Undaunted. If I must contend, said he, Best with the best, the Sender not the sent, Or all at once; more glorie will be wonn, Or less be lost. Thy fear, said Zephon bold, Will save us trial what the least can doe Single against thee wicked, and thence weak. The Fiend repli&amp;#39;d not, overcome with rage; But like a proud Steed reind, went hautie on, Chaumping his iron curb: to strive or flie He held it vain; awe from above had quelld His heart, not else dismai&amp;#39;d. Now drew they nigh The western Point, where those half-rounding guard just met, and closing stood in squadron joind Awaiting next command. To whom thir Chief Gabriel from the Front thus calld aloud. O friends, I hear the tread of nimble feet Hasting this way, and now by glimps discerne Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade, And with them comes a third of Regal port, But faded splendor wan; who by his gate And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell, Not likely to part hence without contest; Stand firm, for in his look defiance lours. He scarce had ended, when those two approachd And brief related whom they brought, where found, How busied, in what form and posture coucht. To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake. Why hast thou, Satan broke the bounds prescrib&amp;#39;d To thy transgressions, and disturbd the charge Of others, who approve not to transgress By thy example, but have power and right To question thy bold entrance on this place; Imploi&amp;#39;d it seems to violate sleep, and those Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss? To whom thus Satan, with contemptuous brow. Gabriel, thou hadst in Heav&amp;#39;n th&amp;#39; esteem of wise, And such I held thee; but this question askt Puts me in doubt. Lives ther who loves his pain? Who would not, finding way, break loose from Hell, Though thither doomd? Thou wouldst thy self, no doubt, And boldly venture to whatever place Farthest from pain, where thou mightest hope to change Torment with ease, and soonest recompence Dole with delight, which in this place I sought; To thee no reason; who knowst only good, But evil hast not tri&amp;#39;d: and wilt object His will who bound us? let him surer barr His Iron Gates, if he intends our stay In that dark durance: thus much what was askt. The rest is true, they found me where they say; But that implies not violence or harme. Thus he in scorn.The warlike Angel mov&amp;#39;d, Disdainfully half smiling thus repli&amp;#39;d. O loss of one in Heav&amp;#39;n to judge of wise, Since Satan fell, whom follie overthrew, And now returns him from his prison scap&amp;#39;t, Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither Unlicenc&amp;#39;t from his bounds in Hell prescrib&amp;#39;d; So wise he judges it to fly from pain However, and to scape his punishment. So judge thou still, presumptuous, till the wrauth, Which thou incurr&amp;#39;st by flying, meet thy flight Seavenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to Hell, Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain Can equal anger infinite provok&amp;#39;t. But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee Came not all Hell broke loose? is pain to them Less pain, less to be fled, or thou then they Less hardie to endure? courageous Chief, The first in flight from pain, had&amp;#39;st thou alledg&amp;#39;d To thy deserted host this cause of flight, Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive. To which the Fiend thus answerd frowning stern. Not that I less endure, or shrink from pain, Insulting Angel, well thou knowst I stood Thy fiercest, when in Battel to thy aide Thy blasting volied Thunder made all speed And seconded thy else not dreaded Spear. But still thy words at random, as before, Argue thy inexperience what behooves From hard assaies and ill successes past A faithful Leader, not to hazard all Through wayes of danger by himself untri&amp;#39;d. I therefore, I alone first undertook To wing the desolate Abyss, and spie This new created World, whereof in Hell Fame is not silent, here in hope to find Better abode, and my afflicted Powers To settle here on Earth, or in mid Aire; Though for possession put to try once more What thou and thy gay Legions dare against; Whose easier business were to serve thir Lord High up in Heav&amp;#39;n, with songs to hymne his Throne, And practis&amp;#39;d distances to cringe, not fight. To whom the warriour Angel, soon repli&amp;#39;d. To say and strait unsay, pretending first Wise to flie pain, professing next the Spie, Argues no Leader but a lyar trac&amp;#39;t, Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name, O sacred name of faithfulness profan&amp;#39;d! Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew? Armie of Fiends, fit body to fit head; Was this your discipline and faith ingag&amp;#39;d, Your military obedience, to dissolve Allegeance to th&amp;#39; acknowldg&amp;#39;d Power supream? And thou sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem Patron of liberty, who more then thou Once fawn&amp;#39;d, and cring&amp;#39;d, and servilly ador&amp;#39;d Heav&amp;#39;ns awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope To dispossess him, and thy self to reigne? But mark what I arreede thee now, avant; Flie thither whence thou fledst: if from this houre Within these hallowd limits thou appeer, Back to th&amp;#39; infernal pit I drag thee chaind, And Seale thee so, as henceforth not to scorne The facil gates of hell too slightly barrd. So threatn&amp;#39;d hee, but Satan to no threats Gave heed, but waxing more in rage repli&amp;#39;d. Then when I am thy captive talk of chaines, Proud limitarie Cherube, but ere then Farr heavier load thy self expect to feel From my prevailing arme, though Heavens King Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy Compeers, Us&amp;#39;d to the yoak, draw&amp;#39;st his triumphant wheels In progress through the rode of Heav&amp;#39;n Star-pav&amp;#39;d. While thus he spake, th&amp;#39; Angelic Squadron bright Turnd fierie red, sharpning in mooned hornes Thir Phalanx, and began to hemm him round With ported Spears, as thick as when a field Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends Her bearded Grove of ears, which way the wind Swayes them; the careful Plowman doubting stands Least on the threshing floore his hopeful sheaves Prove chaff. On th&amp;#39; other side Satan allarm&amp;#39;d Collecting all his might dilated stood, Like Teneriff or Atlas unremov&amp;#39;d: His stature reacht the Skie, and on his Crest Sat horror Plum&amp;#39;d; nor wanted in his graspe What seemd both Spear and Shield: now dreadful deeds Might have ensu&amp;#39;d, nor onely Paradise In this commotion, but the Starrie Cope Of Heav&amp;#39;n perhaps, or all the Elements At least had gon to rack, disturbd and torne With violence of this conflict, had not soon Th&amp;#39; Eternal to prevent such horrid fray Hung forth in Heav&amp;#39;n his golden Scales, yet seen Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion signe, Wherein all things created first he weighd, The pendulous round Earth with ballanc&amp;#39;t Aire In counterpoise, now ponders all events, Battels and Realms: in these he put two weights The sequel each of parting and of fight; The latter quick up flew, and kickt the beam; Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the Fiend. Satan, I know thy strength, and thou knowst mine, Neither our own but giv&amp;#39;n; what follie then To boast what Arms can doe, since thine no more Then Heav&amp;#39;n permits, nor mine, though doubld now To trample thee as mire: for proof look up, And read thy Lot in yon celestial Sign Where thou art weigh&amp;#39;d, and shown how light, how weak, If thou resist. The Fiend lookt up and knew His mounted scale aloft: nor more; but fled Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,

AwakeMy fairest, my espous&amp;#39;d, my latest found,Heav&amp;#39;ns last best gift, my ever new delight,Awake, the morning shines, and the fresh fieldCalls us, we lose the prime, to mark how springOur tended Plants, how blows the Citron Grove,What drops the Myrrhe, and what the balmie Reed,How Nature paints her colours, how the BeeSits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet.Such whispering wak&amp;#39;d her, but with startl&amp;#39;d eyeOn Adam, whom imbracing, thus she spake.O Sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,My Glorie, my Perfection, glad I seeThy face, and Morn return&amp;#39;d, for I this Night,Such night till this I never pass&amp;#39;d, have dream&amp;#39;d,If dream&amp;#39;d, not as I oft am wont, of thee,Works of day pass&amp;#39;t, or morrows next designe,But of offence and trouble, which my mindKnew never till this irksom night; methoughtClose at mine ear one call&amp;#39;d me forth to walkWith gentle voice, I though it thine; it said,Why sleepst thou Eve? now is the pleasant time,The cool, the silent, save where silence yieldsTo the night-warbling Bird, that now awakeTunes sweetest his love-labor&amp;#39;d song; now reignesFull Orb&amp;#39;d the Moon, and with more pleasing lightShadowie sets off the face of things; in vain,If none regard; Heav&amp;#39;n wakes with all his eyes,Whom to behold but thee, Natures desire,In whose sight all things joy, with ravishmentAttracted by thy beauty still to gaze.I rose as at thy call, but found thee not;To find thee I directed then my walk;And on, methought, alone I pass&amp;#39;d through waysThat brought me on a sudden to the TreeOf interdicted Knowledge: fair it seem&amp;#39;d,Much fairer to my Fancie then by day:And as I wondring lookt, beside it stoodOne shap&amp;#39;d and wing&amp;#39;d like one of those from Heav&amp;#39;nBy us oft seen; his dewie locks distill&amp;#39;dAmbrosia; on that Tree he also gaz&amp;#39;d;And O fair Plant, said he, with fruit surcharg&amp;#39;d,Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet,Nor God, nor Man; is Knowledge so despis&amp;#39;d?Or envie, or what reserve forbids to taste?Forbid who will, none shall from me withholdLonger thy offerd good, why else set here?This said he paus&amp;#39;d not, but with ventrous ArmeHe pluckt, he tasted; mee damp horror chil&amp;#39;dAt such bold words voucht with a deed so bold:But he thus overjoy&amp;#39;d, O Fruit Divine,Sweet of thy self, but much more sweet thus cropt,Forbidd&amp;#39;n here, it seems, as onely fitFor God&amp;#39;s, yet able to make Gods of Men:And why not Gods of Men, since good, the moreCommunicated, more abundant growes,The Author not impair&amp;#39;d, but honourd more?Here, happie Creature, fair Angelic Eve,Partake thou also; happie though thou art,Happier thou mayst be, worthier canst not be:Taste this, and be henceforth among the GodsThy self a Goddess, not to Earth confind,But somtimes in the Air, as wee, somtimesAscend to Heav&amp;#39;n, by merit thine, and seeWhat life the Gods live there, and such live thou.So saying, he drew nigh, and to me held,Even to my mouth of that same fruit held partWhich he had pluckt; the pleasant savourie smellSo quick&amp;#39;nd appetite, that I, methought,Could not but taste. Forthwith up to the CloudsWith him I flew, and underneath beheldThe Earth outstretcht immense, a prospect wideAnd various: wondring at my flight and changeTo this high exaltation; suddenlyMy Guide was gon, and I, me thought, sunk down,And fell asleep; but O how glad I wak&amp;#39;dTo find this but a dream! Thus Eve her NightRelated, and thus Adam answerd sad.Best image of my self and dearer half,The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleepAffects me equally; nor can I likeThis uncouth dream, of evil sprung I fear;Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none,Created pure. But know that in the SouleAre many lesser Faculties that serveReason as chief; among these Fansie nextHer office holds; of all external things,Which the five watchful Senses represent,She forms Imaginations, Aerie shapes,Which Reason joyning or disjoyning, framesAll what we affirm or what deny, and callOur knowledge or opinion; then retiresInto her private Cell when Nature rests,Oft in her absence mimic Fansie wakesTo imitate her; but misjoyning shapes,Wilde work produces oft, and most in dreams,Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.Som such resemblances methinks I findOf our last Eevnings talk, in this thy dream,But with addition strange; yet be not sad.Evil into the mind of God or ManMay come or go, so unapprov&amp;#39;d, and leaveNo spot or blame behind: Which gives me hopeThat what in sleep thou didst abhorr to dream,Waking thou never wilt consent to do.Be not disheart&amp;#39;nd then, nor cloud those looksThat wont to be more chearful and sereneThen when fair Morning first smiles on the World,And let us to our fresh imployments riseAmong the Groves, the Fountains, and the FloursThat open now thir choicest bosom&amp;#39;d smellsReservd from night, and kept for thee in store.So cheard he his fair Spouse, and she was cheard,But silently a gentle tear let fallFrom either eye, and wip&amp;#39;d them with her haire;Two other precious drops that ready stood,Each in thir Chrystal sluce, hee ere they fellKiss&amp;#39;d as the gracious signs of sweet remorseAnd pious awe, that feard to have offended.So all was cleard, and to the Field they haste.But first from under shadie arborous roof,Soon as they forth were come to open sightOf day-spring, and the Sun, who scarce up risenWith wheels yet hov&amp;#39;ring o&amp;#39;re the Ocean brim,Shot paralel to the earth his dewie ray,Discovering in wide Lantskip all the EastOf Paradise and Edens happie Plains,Lowly they bow&amp;#39;d adoring, and beganThir Orisons, each Morning duly paidIn various style, for neither various styleNor holy rapture wanted they to praiseThir Maker, in fit strains pronounc&amp;#39;t or sungUnmeditated, such prompt eloquenceFlowd from thir lips, in Prose or numerous Verse,More tuneable then needed Lute or HarpTo add more sweetness, and they thus began.These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,Almightie, thine this universal Frame,Thus wondrous fair; thy self how wondrous then!Unspeakable, who first above these HeavensTo us invisible or dimly seenIn these thy lowest works, yet these declareThy goodness beyond thought, and Power Divine:Speak yee who best can tell, ye Sons of light,Angels, for yee behold him, and with songsAnd choral symphonies, Day without Night,Circle his Throne rejoycing, yee in Heav&amp;#39;n,On Earth joyn all ye Creatures to extollHim first, him last, him midst, and without end.Fairest of Starrs, last in the train of Night,If better thou belong not to the dawn,Sure pledge of day, that crownst the smiling MornWith thy bright Circlet, praise him in thy SpheareWhile day arises, that sweet hour of Prime.Thou Sun, of this great World both Eye and Soule,Acknowledge him thy Greater, sound his praiseIn thy eternal course, both when thou climb&amp;#39;st,And when high Noon hast gaind, and when thou fallst.Moon, that now meetst the orient Sun, now fli&amp;#39;stWith the fixt Starrs, fixt in thir Orb that flies,And yee five other wandring Fires that moveIn mystic Dance not without Song, resoundHis praise, who out of Darkness call&amp;#39;d up Light,Aire, and ye Elements the eldest birthOf Natures Womb, that in quaternion runPerpetual Circle, multiform;

and wave your tops, ye Pines,With every Plant, in sign of Worship wave.Fountains and yee, that warble, as ye flow,Melodious murmurs, warbling tune his praise.Joyn voices all ye living Souls, ye Birds,That singing up to Heaven gate ascend,Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise;Yee that in Waters glide, and yee that walkThe Earth, and stately tread, or lowly creep;Witness if I be silent, Morn or Eeven,To Hill, or Valley, Fountain, or fresh shadeMade vocal by my Song, and taught his praise.Hail universal Lord, be bounteous stillTo give us onely good; and if the nightHave gathered aught of evil or conceald,Disperse it, as now light dispels the dark.So pray&amp;#39;d they innocent, and to thir thoughtsFirm peace recoverd soon and wonted calm.On to thir mornings rural work they hasteAmong sweet dewes and flours; where any rowOf Fruit-trees overwoodie reachd too farrThir pamperd boughes, and needed hands to checkFruitless imbraces: or they led the VineTo wed her Elm; she spous&amp;#39;d about him twinesHer mariageable arms, and with her bringsHer dowr th&amp;#39;

As when by night the GlassOf Galileo, less assur&amp;#39;d, observesImagind Lands and Regions in the Moon:Or Pilot from amidst the CycladesDelos or Samos first appeering kennsA cloudy spot. Down thither prone in flightHe speeds, and through the vast Ethereal SkieSailes between worlds and worlds, with steddie wingNow on the polar windes, then with quick FannWinnows the buxom Air; till within soareOf Towring Eagles, to all the Fowles he seemsA Phoenix, gaz&amp;#39;d by all, as that sole BiradWhen to enshrine his reliques in the Sun&amp;#39;sBright Temple, to Aegyptian Theb&amp;#39;s he flies.At once on th&amp;#39; Eastern cliff of ParadiseHe lights, and to his proper shape returnsA Seraph wingd; six wings he wore, to shadeHis lineaments Divine; the pair that cladEach shoulder broad, came mantling o&amp;#39;re his brestWith regal Ornament; the middle pairGirt like a Starrie Zone his waste, and roundSkirted his loines and thighes with downie GoldAnd colours dipt in Heav&amp;#39;n; the third his feetShaddowd from either heele with featherd maileSkie-tinctur&amp;#39;d grain.

Adam, earths hallowd mouldOf God inspir&amp;#39;d, small store will serve, where store,All seasons, ripe for use hangs on the stalk;Save what by frugal storing firmness gainsTo nourish, and superfluous moist consumes:But I will haste and from each bough and break,Each Plant and juciest Gourd will pluck such choiceTo entertain our Angel guest, as heeBeholding shall confess that here on EarthGod hath dispenst his bounties as in Heav&amp;#39;n.So saying, with dispatchful looks in hasteShe turns, on hospitable thoughts intentWhat choice to chuse for delicacie best,What order, so contriv&amp;#39;d as not to mixTastes, not well joynd, inelegant, but bringTaste after taste upheld with kindliest change,Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalkWhatever Earth all-bearing Mother yieldsIn India East or West, or middle shoareIn Pontus or the Punic Coast, or whereAlcinous reign&amp;#39;d, fruit of all kindes, in coate,Rough, or smooth rin&amp;#39;d, or bearded husk, or shellShe gathers, Tribute large, and on the boardHeaps with unsparing hand; for drink the GrapeShe crushes, inoffensive moust, and meathesFrom many a berrie, and from sweet kernels prestShe tempers dulcet creams, nor these to holdWants her fit vessels pure, then strews the groundWith Rose and Odours from the shrub unfum&amp;#39;d.Mean while our Primitive great Sire, to meetHis god-like Guest, walks forth, without more trainAccompani&amp;#39;d then with his own compleatPerfections, in himself was all his state,More solemn then the tedious pomp that waitsOn Princes, when thir rich Retinue longOf Horses led, and Grooms besmeard with GoldDazles the croud, and sets them all agape.Neerer his presence Adam though not awd,Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek,As to a superior Nature, bowing low,Thus said.

A while discourse they hold;No fear lest Dinner coole; when thus beganOur Authour. Heav&amp;#39;nly stranger, please to tasteThese bounties which our Nourisher, from whomAll perfet good unmeasur&amp;#39;d out, descends,To us for food and for delight hath caus&amp;#39;dThe Earth to yield; unsavourie food perhapsTo spiritual Natures; only this I know,That one Celestial Father gives to all.To whom the Angel. Therefore what he gives(Whose praise be ever sung) to man in partSpiritual, may of purest Spirits be foundNo ingrateful food; and food alike those pureIntelligential substances requireAs doth your Rational; and both containWithin them every lower facultieOf sense, whereby they hear, see, smell, touch, taste,Tasting concoct, digest, assimilate,And corporeal to incorporeal turn.For know, whatever was created, needsTo be sustaind and fed; of ElementsThe grosser feeds the purer, Earth the Sea,Earth and the Sea feed Air, the Air those FiresEthereal, and as lowest first the Moon;Whence in her visage round those spots, unpurg&amp;#39;dVapours not yet into her substance turnd.Nor doth the Moon no nourishment exhaleFrom her moist Continent to higher Orbes.The Sun that light imparts to all, receivesFrom all his alimental recompenceIn humid exhalations, and at EvenSups with the Ocean: though in Heav&amp;#39;n the TreesOf life ambrosial frutage bear, and vinesYield Nectar, though from off the boughs each MornWe brush mellifluous Dewes, and find the groundCover&amp;#39;d with pearly grain: yet God hath hereVaried his bounty so with new delights,As may compare with Heaven; and to tasteThink not I shall be nice. So down they sat,And to thir viands fell, nor seeminglyThe Angel, nor in mist, the common glossOf Theologians, but with keen dispatchOf real hunger, and concoctive heate.To transubstantiate; what redounds, transpiresThrough Spirits with ease; nor wonder; if by fireOf sooty coal the Empiric AlchimistCan turn, or holds it possible to turnMetals of drossiest Ore to perfet GoldAs from the Mine. Mean while at Table EveMinisterd naked, and thir flowing cupsWith pleasant liquors crown&amp;#39;d: O innocenceDeserving Paradise! if ever, then,Then had the Sons of God excuse to have binEnamour&amp;#39;d at that sight; but in those heartsLove unlibidinous reign&amp;#39;d, nor jealousieWas understood, the injur&amp;#39;d Lovers Hell.Thus when with meats and drinks they had suffic&amp;#39;d,Not burd&amp;#39;nd Nature, sudden mind aroseIn Adam, not to let th&amp;#39; occasion passGiven him by this great Conference to knowOf things above his World, and of thir beingWho dwell in Heav&amp;#39;n, whose excellence he sawTranscend his own so farr, whose radiant formsDivine effulgence, whose high Power so farExceeded human, and his wary speechThus to th&amp;#39; Empyreal Minister he fram&amp;#39;d.Inhabitant with God, now know I wellThy favour, in this honour done to man,Under whose lowly roof thou hast voutsaf&amp;#39;tTo enter, and these earthly fruits to taste,Food not of Angels, yet accepted so,As that more willingly thou couldst not seemAs Heav&amp;#39;ns high feasts to have fed: yet what compare?To whom the winged Hierarch repli&amp;#39;d.O Adam, one Almightie is, from whomAll things proceed, and up to him return,If not deprav&amp;#39;d from good, created allSuch to perfection, one first matter all,Indu&amp;#39;d with various forms various degreesOf substance, and in things that live, of life;But more refin&amp;#39;d, more spiritous, and pure,As neerer to him plac&amp;#39;t or neerer tendingEach in thir several active Sphears assignd,Till body up to spirit work, in boundsProportiond to each kind.

But say,What meant that caution joind, if ye be foundObedient? can we want obedience thenTo him, or possibly his love desertWho formd us from the dust, and plac&amp;#39;d us hereFull to the utmost measure of what blissHuman desires can seek or apprehend?To whom the Angel. Son of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth,Attend: That thou are happie, owe to God;That thou continu&amp;#39;st such, owe to thy self,That is, to thy obedience; therein stand.This was that caution giv&amp;#39;n thee; be advis&amp;#39;d.God made thee perfet, not immutable;And good he made thee, but to persevereHe left it in thy power, ordaind thy willBy nature free, not over-rul&amp;#39;d by FateInextricable, or strict necessity;Our voluntarie service he requires,Not our necessitated, such with himFindes no acceptance, nor can find, for howCan hearts, not free, be tri&amp;#39;d whether they serveWilling or no, who will but what they mustBy Destinie, and can no other choose?My self and all th&amp;#39; Angelic Host that standIn sight of God enthron&amp;#39;d, our happie stateHold, as you yours, while our obedience holds;On other surety none; freely we serve,Because wee freely love, as in our willTo love or not; in this we stand or fall:And som are fall&amp;#39;n, to disobedience fall&amp;#39;n,And so from Heav&amp;#39;n to deepest Hell; O fallFrom what high state of bliss into what woe!To whom our great Progenitor. Thy wordsAttentive, and with more delighted eare,Divine instructer, I have heard, then whenCherubic Songs by night from neighbouring HillsAereal Music send: nor knew I notTo be both will and deed created free;Yet that we never shall forget to loveOur maker, and obey him whose commandSingle, is yet so just, my constant thoughtsAssur&amp;#39;d me, and still assure: though what thou tellstHath past in Heav&amp;#39;n, som doubt within me move,But more desire to hear, if thou consent,The full relation, which must needs be strange,Worthy of Sacred silence to be heard;And we have yet large day, for scarce the SunHath finisht half his journey, and scarce beginsHis other half in the great Zone of Heav&amp;#39;n.Thus Adam made request, and RaphaelAfter short pause assenting, thus began.High matter thou injoinst me, O prime of men,Sad task and hard, for how shall I relateTo human sense th&amp;#39; invisible exploitsOf warring Spirits; how without remorseThe ruin of so many glorious onceAnd perfet while they stood; how last unfouldThe secrets of another world, perhapsNot lawful to reveal? yet for thy goodThis is dispenc&amp;#39;t, and what surmounts the reachOf human sense, I shall delineate so,By lik&amp;#39;ning spiritual to corporal forms,As may express them best, though what if EarthBe but the shaddow of Heav&amp;#39;n, and things thereinEach to other like, more then on earth is thought?As yet this world was not, and Chaos wildeReignd where these Heav&amp;#39;ns now rowl, where Earth now restsUpon her Center pois&amp;#39;d, when on a day(For Time, though in Eternitie, appli&amp;#39;dTo motion, measures all things durableBy present, past, and future) on such dayAs Heav&amp;#39;ns great Year brings forth, th&amp;#39; Empyreal HostOf Angels by Imperial summons call&amp;#39;d,Innumerable before th&amp;#39; Almighties ThroneForthwith from all the ends of Heav&amp;#39;n appeerdUnder thir Hierarchs in orders brightTen thousand thousand Ensignes high advanc&amp;#39;d,Standards, and Gonfalons twixt Van and ReareStreame in the Aire, and for distinction serveOf Hierarchies, of Orders, and Degrees;Or in thir glittering Tissues bear imblaz&amp;#39;dHoly Memorials, acts of Zeale and LoveRecorded eminent. Thus when in OrbsOf circuit inexpressible they stood,Orb within Orb, the Father infinite,By whom in bliss imbosom&amp;#39;d sat the Son,Amidst as from a flaming Mount, whose topBrightness had made invisible, thus spake.Hear all ye Angels, Progenie of Light,Thrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,Hear my Decree, which unrevok&amp;#39;t shall stand.This day I have begot whom I declareMy onely Son, and on this holy HillHim have anointed, whom ye now beholdAt my right hand; your Head I him appoint;And by my Self have sworn to him shall bowAll knees in Heav&amp;#39;n, and shall confess him Lord:Under his great Vice-gerent Reign abideUnited as one individual SouleFor ever happie: him who disobeyesMee disobeyes, breaks union, and that dayCast out from God and blessed vision, fallsInto utter darkness, deep ingulft, his placeOrdaind without redemption, without end.So spake th&amp;#39; Omnipotent, and with his wordsAll seemd well pleas&amp;#39;d, all seem&amp;#39;d, but were not all.That day, as other solemn dayes, they spentIn song and dance about the sacred Hill,Mystical dance, which yonder starrie SpheareOf Planets and of fixt in all her WheelesResembles nearest, mazes intricate,Eccentric, intervolv&amp;#39;d, yet regularThen most, when most irregular they seem,And in thir motions harmonie DivineSo smooths her charming tones, that Gods own earListens delighted. Eevning now approach&amp;#39;d(For wee have also our Eevning and our Morn,Wee ours for change delectable, not need)Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turnDesirous; all in Circles as they stood,Tables are set, and on a sudden pil&amp;#39;dWith Angels Food, and rubied Nectar flowsIn Pearl, in Diamond, and massie GoldFruit of delicious Vines, the growth of Heav&amp;#39;n.On flours repos&amp;#39;d, and with fresh flourets crownd,They eate, they drink, and in communion sweetQuaff immortalitie and joy, secureOf surfet where full measure onely boundsExcess, before th&amp;#39; all bounteous King, who showrdWith copious hand, rejoycing in thir joy.Now when ambrosial Night with Clouds exhal&amp;#39;dFrom that high mount of God, whence light &amp;amp; shadeSpring both, the face of brightest Heav&amp;#39;n had changdTo grateful Twilight (for Night comes not thereIn darker veile) and roseat Dews dispos&amp;#39;dAll but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest,Wide over all the Plain, and wider farrThen all this globous Earth in Plain out spred,(Such are the Courts of God) Th&amp;#39; Angelic throngDisperst in Bands and Files thir Camp extendBy living Streams among the Trees of Life,Pavilions numberless, and sudden reard,Celestial Tabernacles, where they sleptFannd with cool Winds, save those who in thir courseMelodious Hymns about the sovran ThroneAlternate all night long: but not so wak&amp;#39;dSatan, so call him now, his former nameIs heard no more in Heav&amp;#39;n; he of the first,If not the first Arch-Angel, great in Power,In favour and in praeeminence, yet fraughtWith envie against the Son of God, that dayHonourd by his great Father, and proclaimdMessiah King anointed, could not beareThrough pride that sight, &amp;amp; thought himself impaird.Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain,Soon as midnight brought on the duskie houreFriendliest to sleep and silence, he resolv&amp;#39;dWith all his Legions to dislodge, and leaveUnworshipt, unobey&amp;#39;d the Throne supreamContemptuous, and his next subordinateAwak&amp;#39;ning, thus to him in secret spake.Sleepst thou Companion dear, what sleep can closeThy eye-lids: and remembrest what DecreeOf yesterday, so late hath past the lipsOf Heav&amp;#39;ns Almightie. Thou to me thy thoughtsWast wont, I mine to thee was wont to impart;Both waking we were one; how then can nowThy sleep dissent? new Laws thou seest impos&amp;#39;d;New Laws from him who reigns, new minds may raiseIn us who serve, new Counsels, to debateWhat doubtful may ensue, more in this placeTo utter is not safe. Assemble thouOf all those Myriads which we lead the chief;Tell them that by command, ere yet dim NightHer shadowie Cloud withdraws, I am to haste,And all who under me thir Banners wave,Homeward with flying march where we possessThe Quarters of the North, there to prepareFit entertainment to receive our KingThe great Messiah, and his new commands,Who speedily through all the HierarchiesIntends to pass triumphant, and give Laws.So spake the false Arch-Angel, and infus&amp;#39;dBad influence into th&amp;#39; unwarie brestOf his Associate; hee together calls,Or several one by one, the Regent Powers,Under him Regent, tells, as he was taught,That the most High commanding, now ere Night,Now ere dim Night had disincumberd Heav&amp;#39;n,The great Hierarchal Standard was to move;Tells the suggested cause, and cast betweenAmbiguous words and jealousies, to soundOr taint integritie; but all obey&amp;#39;dThe wonted signal, and superior voiceOf thir great Potentate; for great indeedHis name, and high was his degree in Heav&amp;#39;n;His count&amp;#39;nance, as the Morning Starr that guidesThe starrie flock, allur&amp;#39;d them, and with lyesDrew after him the third part of Heav&amp;#39;ns Host:Mean while th&amp;#39; Eternal eye, whose sight discernesAbstrusest thoughts, from forth his holy MountAnd from within the golden Lamps that burneNightly before him, saw without thir lightRebellion rising, saw in whom, how spredAmong the sons of Morn, what multitudesWere banded to oppose his high Decree;And smiling to his onely Son thus said.Son, thou in whom my glory I beholdIn full resplendence, Heir of all my might,Neerly it now concernes us to be sureOf our Omnipotence, and with what ArmsWe mean to hold what anciently we claimOf Deitie or Empire, such a foeIs rising, who intends to erect his ThroneEqual to ours, throughout the spacious North;Nor so content, hath in his thought to tryIn battel, what our Power is, or our right.Let us advise, and to this hazard drawWith speed what force is left, and all imployIn our defence, lest unawares we loseThis our high place, our Sanctuarie, our Hill.To whom the Son with calm aspect and cleerLight&amp;#39;ning Divine, ineffable, serene,Made answer. Mightie Father, thou thy foesJustly hast in derision, and secureLaugh&amp;#39;st at thir vain designes and tumults vain,Matter to mee of Glory, whom thir hateIllustrates, when they see all Regal PowerGiv&amp;#39;n me to quell thir pride, and in eventKnow whether I be dextrous to subdueThy Rebels, or be found the worst in Heav&amp;#39;n.So spake the Son, but Satan with his PowersFar was advanc&amp;#39;t on winged speed, an HostInnumerable as the Starrs of Night,Or Starrs of Morning, Dew-drops, which the SunImpearls on every leaf and every flouer.Regions they pass&amp;#39;d, the mightie RegenciesOf Seraphim and Potentates and ThronesIn thir triple Degrees, Regions to whichAll thy Dominion, Adam, is no moreThen what this Garden is to all the Earth,And all the Sea, from one entire globoseStretcht into Longitude; which having pass&amp;#39;dAt length into the limits of the NorthThey came, and Satan to his Royal seatHigh on a Hill, far blazing, as a MountRais&amp;#39;d on a Mount, with Pyramids and TowrsFrom Diamond Quarries hew&amp;#39;n, and Rocks of Gold,The Palace of great Lucifer, (so callThat Structure in the Dialect of menInterpreted) which not long after, heAffecting all equality with God,In imitation of that Mount whereonMessiah was delar&amp;#39;d in sight of Heav&amp;#39;n,The Mountain of the Congregation call&amp;#39;d;For thither he assembl&amp;#39;d all his Train,Pretending so commanded to consultAbout the great reception of thir King,Thither to come, and with calumnious ArtOf counterfeted truth thus held thir ears.Thrones, Dominations, Princedomes, Vertues, Powers,If these magnific Titles yet remainNot meerly titular, since by DecreeAnother now hath to himself ingross&amp;#39;tAll Power, and us eclipst under the nameOf King anointed, for whom all this hasteOf midnight march, and hurried meeting here,This onely to consult how we may bestWith what may be devis&amp;#39;d of honours newReceive him coming to receive from usKnee-tribute yet unpaid, prostration vile,Too much to one, but double how endur&amp;#39;d,To one and to his image now proclaim&amp;#39;d?But what if better counsels might erectOur minds and teach us to cast off this Yoke?Will ye submit your necks, and chuse to bendThe supple knee? ye will not, if I trustTo know ye right, or if ye know your selvesNatives and Sons of Heav&amp;#39;n possest beforeBy none, and if not equal all, yet free,Equally free; for Orders and DegreesJarr not with liberty, but well consist.Who can in reason then or right assumeMonarchie over such as live by rightHis equals, if in power and splendor less,In freedome equal? or can introduceLaw and Edict on us, who without lawErre not, much less for this to be our Lord,And look for adoration to th&amp;#39; abuseOf those Imperial Titles which assertOur being ordain&amp;#39;d to govern, not to serve?Thus farr his bold discourse without controuleHad audience, when among the SeraphimAbdiel, then whom none with more zeale ador&amp;#39;dThe Deitie, and divine commands obei&amp;#39;d,Stood up, and in a flame of zeale severeThe current of his fury thus oppos&amp;#39;d.O argument blasphemous, false and proud!Words which no eare ever to hear in Heav&amp;#39;nExpected, least of all from thee, ingrateIn place thy self so high above thy Peeres.Canst thou with impious obloquie condemneThe just Decree of God, pronounc&amp;#39;t and sworn,That to his only Son by right endu&amp;#39;dWith Regal Scepter, every Soule in Heav&amp;#39;nShall bend the knee, and in that honour dueConfess him rightful King? unjust thou saistFlatly unjust, to binde with Laws the free,And equal over equals to let Reigne,One over all with unsucceeded power.Shalt thou give Law to God, shalt thou disputeWith him the points of libertie, who madeThee what thou art, and formd the Pow&amp;#39;rs of Heav&amp;#39;nSuch as he pleasd, and circumscrib&amp;#39;d thir being?Yet by experience taught we know how good,And of our good, and of our dignitieHow provident he is, how farr from thoughtTo make us less, bent rather to exaltOur happie state under one Head more neerUnited. But to grant it thee unjust,That equal over equals Monarch Reigne:Thy self though great and glorious dost thou count,Or all Angelic Nature joind in one,Equal to him begotten Son, by whomAs by his Word the mighty Father madeAll things, ev&amp;#39;n thee, and all the Spirits of Heav&amp;#39;nBy him created in thir bright degrees,Crownd them with Glory, and to thir Glory nam&amp;#39;dThrones, Dominations, Princedoms, Vertues, Powers,Essential Powers, nor by his Reign obscur&amp;#39;d,But more illustrious made, since he the HeadOne of our number thus reduc&amp;#39;t becomes,His Laws our Laws, all honour to him doneReturns our own. Cease then this impious rage,And tempt not these; but hast&amp;#39;n to appeaseTh&amp;#39; incensed Father, and th&amp;#39; incensed Son,While Pardon may be found in time besought.So spake the fervent Angel, but his zealeNone seconded, as out of season judg&amp;#39;d,Or singular and rash, whereat rejoic&amp;#39;dTh&amp;#39; Apostat, and more haughty thus repli&amp;#39;d.That were formd then saist thou? and the workOf secondarie hands, by task transferdFrom Father to his Son? strange point and new!Doctrin which we would know whence learnt: who sawWhen this creation was? rememberst thouThy making, while the Maker gave thee being?We know no time when we were not as now;Know none before us, self-begot, self-rais&amp;#39;dBy our own quick&amp;#39;ning power, when fatal courseHad circl&amp;#39;d his full Orbe, the birth matureOf this our native Heav&amp;#39;n, Ethereal Sons.Our puissance is our own, our own right handShall teach us highest deeds, by proof to tryWho is our equal: then thou shalt beholdWhether by supplication we intendAddress, and to begirt th&amp;#39; Almighty ThroneBeseeching or besieging. This report,These tidings carrie to th&amp;#39; anointed King;And fly, ere evil intercept thy flight.He said, and as the sound of waters deepHoarce murmur echo&amp;#39;d to his words applauseThrough the infinite Host, nor less for thatThe flaming Seraph fearless, though aloneEncompass&amp;#39;d round with foes, thus answerd bold.O alienate from God, O spirit accurst,Forsak&amp;#39;n of all good; I see thy fallDetermind, and thy hapless crew involv&amp;#39;dIn this perfidious fraud, contagion spredBoth of thy crime and punishment: henceforthNot more be troubl&amp;#39;d how to quit the yokeOf Gods Messiah; those indulgent LawsWill not be now voutsaf&amp;#39;t, other DecreesAgainst thee are gon forth without recall;That Golden Scepter which thou didst rejectIs now an Iron Rod to bruise and breakThy disobedience. Well thou didst advise,Yet not for thy advise or threats I flyThese wicked Tents devoted, least the wrauthImpendent, raging into sudden flameDistinguish not: for soon expect to feelHis Thunder on thy head, devouring fire.Then who created thee lamenting learne,When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know.So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found,Among the faithless, faithful only hee;Among innumerable false, unmov&amp;#39;d,Unshak&amp;#39;n, unseduc&amp;#39;d, unterrifi&amp;#39;dHis Loyaltie he kept, his Love, his Zeale;Nor number, nor example with him wroughtTo swerve from truth, or change his constant mindThough single. From amidst them forth he pass&amp;#39;d,Long way through hostile scorn, which he susteindSuperior, nor of violence fear&amp;#39;d aught;And with retorted scorn his back he turn&amp;#39;dOn those proud Towrs to swift destruction doom&amp;#39;d.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;ALL night the dreadless Angel unpursu\&amp;#39;d Through Heav\&amp;#39;ns wide Champain held his way, till Morn, Wak\&amp;#39;t by the circling Hours, with rosie hand Unbarr\&amp;#39;d the gates of Light. There is a Cave Within the Mount of God, fast by his Throne, Where light and darkness in perpetual round Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heav\&amp;#39;n Grateful vicissitude, like Day and Night; Light issues forth, and at the other dore Obsequious darkness enters, till her houre To veile the Heav\&amp;#39;n, though darkness there might well Seem twilight here; and now went forth the Morn Such as in highest Heav\&amp;#39;n, arrayd in Gold Empyreal, from before her vanisht Night, Shot through with orient Beams: when all the Plain Coverd with thick embatteld Squadrons bright, Chariots and flaming Armes, and fierie Steeds Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view: Warr he perceav\&amp;#39;d, warr in procinct, and found Already known what he for news had thought To have reported: gladly then he mixt Among those friendly Powers who him receav\&amp;#39;d With joy and acclamations loud, that one That of so many Myriads fall\&amp;#39;n, yet one Returnd not lost: On to the sacred hill They led him high applauded, and present Before the seat supream; from whence a voice From midst a Golden Cloud thus milde was heard. Servant of God, well done, well hast thou fought The better fight, who single hast maintaind Against revolted multitudes the Cause Of Truth, in word mightier then they in Armes; And for the testimonie of Truth hast born Universal reproach, far worse to beare Then violence: for this was all thy care To stand approv\&amp;#39;d in sight of God, though Worlds Judg\&amp;#39;d thee perverse: the easier conquest now Remains thee, aided by this host of friends, Back on thy foes more glorious to return Then scornd thou didst depart, and to subdue By force, who reason for thir Law refuse, Right reason for thir Law, and for thir King Messiah, who by right of merit Reigns. Go Michael of Celestial Armies Prince, And thou in Military prowess next Gabriel, lead forth to Battel these my Sons Invincible, lead forth my armed Saints By Thousands and by Millions rang\&amp;#39;d for fight; Equal in number to that Godless crew Rebellious, them with Fire and hostile Arms Fearless assault, and to the brow of Heav\&amp;#39;n Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss, Into thir place of punishment, the Gulf Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide His fiery Chaos to receave thir fall. So spake the Sovran voice, and Clouds began To darken all the Hill, and smoak to rowl In duskie wreathes, reluctant flames, the signe Of wrauth awak\&amp;#39;t: nor with less dread the loud Ethereal Trumpet from on high gan blow: At which command the Powers Militant, That stood for Heav\&amp;#39;n, in mighty Quadrate joyn&amp;quot;d Of Union irresistible, mov\&amp;#39;d on In silence thir bright Legions, to the sound Of instrumental Harmonie that breath\&amp;#39;d Heroic Ardor to advent\&amp;#39;rous deeds Under thir God-like Leaders, in the Cause Of God and his Messiah. On they move Indissolubly firm; nor obvious Hill, Nor streit\&amp;#39;ning Vale, nor Wood, nor Stream divides Thir perfet ranks; for high above the ground Thir march was, and the passive Air upbore Thir nimble tread, as when the total kind Of Birds in orderly array on wing Came summond over Eden to receive Thir names of thee; so over many a tract Of Heav\&amp;#39;n they march\&amp;#39;d, and many a Province wide Tenfold the length of this terrene: at last Farr in th\&amp;#39; Horizon to the North appeer\&amp;#39;d From skirt to skirt a fierie Region, stretcht In battailous aspect, and neerer view Bristl\&amp;#39;d with upright beams innumerable Of rigid Spears, and Helmets throng\&amp;#39;d, and Shields Various, with boastful Argument portraid, The banded Powers of Satan hasting on With furious expedition; for they weend That self same day by fight, or by surprize To win the Mount of God, and on his Throne To set the envier of his State, the proud Aspirer, but thir thoughts prov\&amp;#39;d fond and vain In the mid way: though strange to us it seemd At first, that Angel should with Angel warr, And in fierce hosting meet, who wont to meet So oft in Festivals of joy and love Unanimous, as sons of one great Sire Hymning th\&amp;#39; Eternal Father: but the shout Of Battel now began, and rushing sound Of onset ended soon each milder thought. High in the midst exalted as a God Th\&amp;#39; Apostat in his Sun-bright Chariot sate Idol of Majestie Divine, enclos\&amp;#39;d With Flaming Cherubim, and golden Shields; Then lighted from his gorgeous Throne, for now \&amp;#39;Twixt Host and Host but narrow space was left, A dreadful intervall, and Front to Front Presented stood in terrible array Of hideous length: before the cloudie Van, On the rough edge of battel ere it joyn,d, Satan with vast and haughtie strides advanc\&amp;#39;t, Came towring, armd in Adamant and Gold; Abdiel that sight endur\&amp;#39;d not, where he stood Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds, And thus his own undaunted heart explores. O Heav\&amp;#39;n! that such resemblance of the Highest Should yet remain, where faith and realtie Remain not; wherfore should not strength and might There fail where Vertue fails, or weakest prove Where boldest; though to sight unconquerable? His puissance, trusting in th\&amp;#39; Almightie\&amp;#39;s aide, I mean to try, whose Reason I have tri\&amp;#39;d Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just, That he who in debate of Truth hath won, Should win in Arms, in both disputes alike Victor; though brutish that contest and foule, When Reason hath to deal with force, yet so Most reason is that Reason overcome. So pondering, and from his armed Peers Forth stepping opposite, half way he met His daring foe, at this prevention more Incens\&amp;#39;t, and thus securely him defi\&amp;#39;d. Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reacht The highth of thy aspiring unoppos\&amp;#39;d, The Throne of God unguarded, and his side Abandond at the terror of thy Power Or potent tongue; fool, not to think how vain Against th\&amp;#39; Omnipotent to rise in Arms; Who out of smallest things could without end Have rais\&amp;#39;d incessant Armies to defeat Thy folly; or with solitarie hand Reaching beyond all limit at one blow Unaided could have finisht thee, and whelmd Thy Legions under darkness; but thou seest All are not of thy Train; there be who Faith Prefer, and Pietie to God, though then To thee not visible, when I alone Seemd in thy World erroneous to dissent From all: my Sect thou seest, now learn too late How few somtimes may know, when thousands err. Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance Thus answerd. Ill for thee, but in wisht houre Of my revenge, first sought for thou returnst From flight, seditious Angel, to receave Thy merited reward, the first assay Of this right hand provok\&amp;#39;t, since first that tongue Inspir\&amp;#39;d with contradiction durst oppose A third part of the Gods, in Synod met Thir Deities to assert, who while they feel Vigour Divine within them, can allow Omnipotence to none. But well thou comst Before thy fellows, ambitious to win From me som Plume, that thy success may show Destruction to the rest: this pause between (Unanswerd least thou boast) to let thee know; At first I thought that Libertie and Heav\&amp;#39;n To heav\&amp;#39;nly Soules had bin all one; but now I see that most through sloth had rather serve, Ministring Spirits, traind up in Feast and Song; Such hast thou arm\&amp;#39;d, the Ministrelsie of Heav\&amp;#39;n, Servilitie with freedom to contend, As both thir deeds compar\&amp;#39;d this day shall prove. To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern repli\&amp;#39;d. Apostat, still thou errst, nor end wilt find Of erring, from the path of truth remote: Unjustly thou deprav\&amp;#39;st it with the name Of Servitude to serve whom God ordains, Or Nature; God and Nature bid the same, When he who rules is worthiest, and excells Them whom he governs. This is servitude, To serve th\&amp;#39; unwise, or him who hath rebelld Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee, Thy self not free, but to thy self enthrall\&amp;#39;d; Yet leudly dar\&amp;#39;st our ministring upbraid. Reign thou in Hell thy Kingdom, let mee serve In Heav\&amp;#39;n God ever blest, and his Divine Behests obey, worthiest to be obey\&amp;#39;d, Yet Chains in Hell, not Realms expect: mean while From mee returnd, as erst thou saidst, from flight, This greeting on thy impious Crest receive. So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high, Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell On the proud Crest of Satan, that no sight, Nor motion of swift thought, less could his Shield Such ruin intercept: ten paces huge He back recoild; the tenth on bended knee His massie Spear upstaid; as if on Earth Winds under ground or waters forcing way Sidelong, had push\&amp;#39;t a Mountain from his seat Half sunk with all his Pines. Amazement seis\&amp;#39;d The Rebel Thrones, but greater rage to see Thus foil\&amp;#39;d thir mightiest, ours joy filld, and shout, Presage of Victorie and fierce desire Of Battel: whereat Michael bid sound Th\&amp;#39; Arch-Angel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven It sounded, and the faithful Armies rung Hosanna to the Highest: nor stood at gaze The adverse Legions, nor less hideous joyn\&amp;#39;d The horrid shock: now storming furie rose, And clamour such as heard in Heav\&amp;#39;n till now Was never, Arms on Armour clashing bray\&amp;#39;d Horrible discord, and the madding Wheeles Of brazen Chariots rag\&amp;#39;d; dire was the noise Of conflict; over head the dismal hiss Of fiery Darts in flaming volies flew, And flying vaulted either Host with fire. So under fierie Cope together rush\&amp;#39;d Both Battels maine, with ruinous assault And inextinguishable rage; all Heav\&amp;#39;n Resounded, and had Earth bin then, all Earth Had to her Center shook. What wonder? when Millions of fierce encountring Angels fought On either side, the least of whom could weild These Elements, and arm him with the force Of all thir Regions: how much more of Power Armie against Armie numberless to raise Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb, Though not destroy, thir happie Native seat; Had not th\&amp;#39; Eternal King Omnipotent From his strong hold of Heav\&amp;#39;n high over-rul\&amp;#39;d And limited thir might; though numberd such As each divided Legion might have seemd A numerous Host, in strength each armed hand A Legion; led in fight, yet Leader seemd Each Warriour single as in Chief, expert When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway Of Battel, open when, and when to close The ridges of grim Warr; no thought of flight, None of retreat, no unbecoming deed That argu\&amp;#39;d fear; each on himself reli\&amp;#39;d, As onely in his arm the moment lay Of victorie; deeds of eternal fame Were don, but infinite: for wide was spred That Warr and various; somtimes on firm ground A standing fight, then soaring on main wing Tormented all the Air; all Air seemd then Conflicting Fire: long time in eeven scale The Battel hung; till Satan, who that day Prodigious power had shewn, and met in Armes No equal, raunging through the dire attack Of fighting Seraphim confus\&amp;#39;d, at length Saw where the Sword of Michael smote, and fell\&amp;#39;d Squadrons at once, with huge two-handed sway Brandisht aloft the horrid edge came down Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand He hasted, and oppos\&amp;#39;d the rockie Orb Of tenfold Adamant, his ample Shield A vast circumference: At his approach The great Arch-Angel from his warlike toile Surceas\&amp;#39;d, and glad as hoping here to end Intestine War in Heav\&amp;#39;n, the arch foe subdu\&amp;#39;d Or Captive drag\&amp;#39;d in Chains, with hostile frown And visage all enflam\&amp;#39;d first thus began. Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt, Unnam\&amp;#39;d in Heav\&amp;#39;n, now plenteous, as thou seest These Acts of hateful strife, hateful to all, Though heaviest by just measure on thy self And thy adherents: how hast thou disturb d Heav\&amp;#39;ns blessed peace, and into Nature brought Miserie, uncreated till the crime Of thy Rebellion? how hast thou instill\&amp;#39;d Thy malice into thousands, once upright And faithful, now prov\&amp;#39;d false. But think not here To trouble Holy Rest; Heav\&amp;#39;n casts thee out From all her Confines. Heav\&amp;#39;n the seat of bliss Brooks not the works of violence and Warr. Hence then, and evil go with thee along Thy ofspring, to the place of evil, Hell, Thou and thy wicked crew; there mingle broiles, Ere this avenging Sword begin thy doome, Or som more sudden vengeance wing\&amp;#39;d from God Precipitate thee with augmented paine. So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus The Adversarie. Nor think thou with wind Of airie threats to aw whom yet with deeds Thou canst not. Hast thou turnd the least of these To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise Unvanquisht, easier to transact with mee That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats To chase me hence? erre not that so shall end The strife which thou call\&amp;#39;st evil, but wee style The strife of Glorie: which we mean to win, Or turn this Heav\&amp;#39;n it self into the Hell Thou fablest, here however to dwell free, If not to reign: mean while thy utmost force, And join him nam\&amp;#39;d Almighty to thy aid, I flie not, but have sought thee farr and nigh. They ended parle, and both addrest for fight Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue Of Angels, can relate, or to what things Liken on Earth conspicuous, that may lift Human imagination to such highth Of Godlike Power: for likest Gods they seemd, Stood they or mov\&amp;#39;d, in stature, motion, arms Fit to decide the Empire of great Heav\&amp;#39;n. Now wav\&amp;#39;d thir fierie Swords, and in the Aire Made horrid Circles; two broad Suns thir Shields Blaz\&amp;#39;d opposite, while expectation stood In horror; from each hand with speed retir\&amp;#39;d Where erst was thickest fight, th\&amp;#39; Angelic throng, And left large field, unsafe within the wind Of such commotion, such as to set forth Great things by small, If Natures concord broke, Among the Constellations warr were sprung, Two Planets rushing from aspect maligne Of fiercest opposition in mid Skie, Should combat, and thir jarring Sphears confound. Together both with next to Almightie Arme, Uplifted imminent one stroke they aim\&amp;#39;d That might determine, and not need repeate, As not of power, at once; nor odds appeerd In might or swift prevention; but the sword Of Michael from the Armorie of God Was giv\&amp;#39;n him temperd so, that neither keen Nor solid might resist that edge: it met The sword of Satan with steep force to smite Descending, and in half cut sheere, nor staid, But with swift wheele reverse, deep entring shar\&amp;#39;d All his right side; then Satan first knew pain, And writh\&amp;#39;d him to and fro convolv\&amp;#39;d; so sore The griding sword with discontinuous wound Pass\&amp;#39;d through him, but th\&amp;#39; Ethereal substance clos\&amp;#39;d Not long divisible, and from the gash A stream of Nectarous humor issuing flow\&amp;#39;d Sanguin, such as Celestial Spirits may bleed, And all his Armour staind ere while so bright. Forthwith on all sides to his aide was run By Angels many and strong, who interpos\&amp;#39;d Defence, while others bore him on thir Shields Back to his Chariot; where it stood retir\&amp;#39;d From off the files of warr; there they him laid Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame To find himself not matchless, and his pride Humbl\&amp;#39;d by such rebuke, so farr beneath His confidence to equal God in power. Yet soon he heal\&amp;#39;d; for Spirits that live throughout Vital in every part, not as frail man In Entrailes, Heart or Head, Liver or Reines; Cannot but by annihilating die; Nor in thir liquid texture mortal wound Receive, no more then can the fluid Aire: All Heart they live, all Head, all Eye, all Eare, All Intellect, all Sense, and as they please, They Limb themselves, and colour, shape or size Assume, as likes them best, condense or rare. Mean while in other parts like deeds deservd Memorial, where the might of Gabriel fought, And with fierce Ensignes pierc\&amp;#39;d the deep array Of Moloc furious King, who him defi\&amp;#39;d, And at his Chariot wheeles to drag him bound Threatn\&amp;#39;d, nor from the Holie One of Heav\&amp;#39;n Refrein\&amp;#39;d his tongue blasphemous; but anon Down clov\&amp;#39;n to the waste, with shatterd Armes And uncouth paine fled bellowing. On each wing Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe, Though huge, and in a Rock of Diamond Armd, Vanquish\&amp;#39;d Adramelec, and Asmadai, Two potent Thrones, that to be less then Gods Disdain\&amp;#39;d, but meaner thoughts learnd in thir flight, Mangl\&amp;#39;d with gastly wounds through Plate and Maile, Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy The Atheist crew, but with redoubl\&amp;#39;d blow Ariel and Arioc, and the violence Of Ramiel scorcht and blasted overthrew. I might relate of thousands, and thir names Eternize here on Earth; but those elect Angels contented with thir fame in Heav\&amp;#39;n Seek not the praise of men: the other sort In might though wondrous and in Acts of Warr, Nor of Renown less eager, yet by doome Canceld from Heav\&amp;#39;n and sacred memorie, Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell. For strength from Truth divided and from Just, Illaudable, naught merits but dispraise And ignominie, yet to glorie aspires Vain glorious, and through infamie seeks fame: Therfore Eternal silence be thir doome. And now thir Mightiest quelld, the battel swerv\&amp;#39;d, With many an inrode gor\&amp;#39;d; deformed rout Enter\&amp;#39;d, and foul disorder; all the ground With shiverd armour strow\&amp;#39;n, and on a heap Chariot and Charioter lay overturnd And fierie foaming Steeds; what stood, recoyld Orewearied, through the faint Satanic Host Defensive scarse, or with pale fear surpris\&amp;#39;d, Then first with fear surpris\&amp;#39;d and sense of paine Fled ignominious, to such evil brought By sin of disobedience, till that hour Not liable to fear or flight or paine. Far otherwise th\&amp;#39; inviolable Saints In Cubic Phalanx firm advanc\&amp;#39;t entire, Invulnerable, impenitrably arm\&amp;#39;d: Such high advantages thir innocence Gave them above thir foes, not to have sinnd, Not to have disobei\&amp;#39;d; in fight they stood Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pain\&amp;#39;d By wound, though from thir place by violence mov\&amp;#39;d. Now Night her course began, and over Heav\&amp;#39;n Inducing darkness, grateful truce impos\&amp;#39;d, And silence on the odious dinn of Warr: Under her Cloudie covert both retir\&amp;#39;d, Victor and Vanquisht: on the foughten field Michael and his Angels prevalent Encamping, plac\&amp;#39;d in Guard thir Watches round, Cherubic waving fires: on th\&amp;#39; other part Satan with his rebellious disappeerd, Far in the dark dislodg\&amp;#39;d, and void of rest, His Potentates to Councel call\&amp;#39;d by night; And in the midst thus undismai\&amp;#39;d began. O now in danger tri\&amp;#39;d, now known in Armes Not to be overpowerd, Companions deare, Found worthy not of Libertie alone, Too mean pretense, but what we more affect, Honour, Dominion, Glorie, and renowne, Who have sustaind one day in doubtful fight (And if one day, why not Eternal dayes?) What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send Against us from about his Throne, and judg\&amp;#39;d Sufficient to subdue us to his will, But proves not so: then fallible, it seems, Of future we may deem him, though till now Omniscient thought. True is, less firmly arm\&amp;#39;d, Some disadvantage we endur\&amp;#39;d and paine, Till now not known, but known as soon contemnd, Since now we find this our Empyreal form Incapable of mortal injurie Imperishable, and though peirc\&amp;#39;d with wound, Soon closing, and by native vigour heal\&amp;#39;d. Of evil then so small as easie think The remedie; perhaps more valid Armes, Weapons more violent, when next we meet, May serve to better us, and worse our foes, Or equal what between us made the odds, In Nature none: if other hidden cause Left them Superiour, while we can preserve Unhurt our mindes, and understanding sound, Due search and consultation will disclose. He sat; and in th\&amp;#39; assembly next upstood Nisroc of Principalities the prime; As one he stood escap\&amp;#39;t from cruel fight, Sore toild, his riv\&amp;#39;n Armes to havoc hewn, And cIoudie in aspect thus answering spake. Deliverer from new Lords, leader to free Enjoyment of our right as Gods; yet hard For Gods, and too unequal work we find Against unequal armes to fight in paine, Against unpaind, impassive; from which evil Ruin must needs ensue; for what availes Valour or strength, though matchless, quelld with pain Which all subdues, and makes remiss the hands Of Mightiest. Sense of pleasure we may well Spare out of life perhaps, and not repine, But live content, which is the calmest life: But pain is perfet miserie, the worst Of evils, and excessive, overturnes All patience. He who therefore can invent With what more forcible we may offend Our yet unwounded Enemies, or arme Our selves with like defence, to me deserves No less then for deliverance what we owe. Whereto with look compos\&amp;#39;d Satan repli\&amp;#39;d. Not uninvented that, which thou aright Believst so main to our success, I bring; Which of us who beholds the bright surface Of this Ethereous mould whereon we stand, This continent of spacious Heav\&amp;#39;n, adornd With Plant, Fruit, Flour Ambrosial, Gemms &amp;amp; Gold, Whose Eye so superficially surveyes These things, as not to mind from whence they grow Deep under ground, materials dark and crude, Of spiritous and fierie spume, till toucht With Heav\&amp;#39;ns ray, and temperd they shoot forth So beauteous, op\&amp;#39;ning to the ambient light. These in thir dark Nativitie the Deep Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame, Which into hallow Engins long and round Thick-rammd, at th\&amp;#39; other bore with touch of fire Dilated and infuriate shall send forth From far with thundring noise among our foes Such implements of mischief as shall dash To pieces, and orewhelm whatever stands Adverse, that they shall fear we have disarmd The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt. Nor long shall be our labour, yet ere dawne, Effect shall end our wish. Mean while revive; Abandon fear; to strength and counsel joind Think nothing hard, much less to be despaird. He ended, and his words thir drooping chere Enlightn\&amp;#39;d, and thir languisht hope reviv\&amp;#39;d. Th\&amp;#39; invention all admir\&amp;#39;d, and each, how hee To be th\&amp;#39; inventer miss\&amp;#39;d, so easie it seemd Once found, which yet unfound most would have thought Impossible: yet haply of thy Race In future dayes, if Malice should aboun, Some one intent on mischief, or inspir\&amp;#39;d With dev\&amp;#39;lish machination might devise Like instrument to plague the Sons of men For sin, on warr and mutual slaughter bent. Forthwith from Councel to the work they flew, None arguing stood, innumerable hands Were ready, in a moment up they turnd Wide the Celestial soile, and saw beneath Th\&amp;#39; originals of Nature in thir crude Conception; Sulphurous and Nitrous Foame They found, they mingl\&amp;#39;d, and with suttle Art, Concocted and adusted they reduc\&amp;#39;d To blackest grain, and into store convey\&amp;#39;d: Part hidd\&amp;#39;n veins diggd up (nor hath this Earth Entrails unlike) of Mineral and Stone, Whereof to found thir Engins and thir Balls Of missive ruin; part incentive reed Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire. So all ere day-spring, under conscious Night Secret they finish\&amp;#39;d, and in order set, With silent circumspection unespi\&amp;#39;d. Now when fair Morn Orient in Heav\&amp;#39;n appeerd Up rose the Victor Angels, and to Arms The matin Trumpet Sung: in Arms they stood Of Golden Panoplie, refulgent Host, Soon banded; others from the dawning Hills Lookd round, and Scouts each Coast light-armed scoure, Each quarter, to descrie the distant foe, Where lodg\&amp;#39;d, or whither fled, or if for fight, In motion or in alt: him soon they met Under spred Ensignes moving nigh, in slow But firm Battalion; back with speediest Sail Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing, Came flying, and in mid Aire aloud thus cri\&amp;#39;d. Arme, Warriours, Arme for fight, the foe at hand, Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit This day, fear not his flight; so thick a Cloud He comes, and settl\&amp;#39;d in his face I see Sad resolution and secure: let each His Adamantine coat gird well, and each Fit well his Helme, gripe fast his orbed Shield, Born eevn or high, for this day will pour down, If I conjecture aught, no drizling showr, But ratling storm of Arrows barbd with fire. So warnd he them aware themselves, and soon In order, quit of all impediment; Instant without disturb they took Allarm, And onward move Embattelld; when behold Not distant far with heavie pace the Foe Approaching gross and huge; in hollow Cube Training his devilish Enginrie, impal\&amp;#39;d On every side with shaddowing Squadrons Deep, To hide the fraud. At interview both stood A while, but suddenly at head appeerd Satan: And thus was heard Commanding loud. Vanguard, to Right and Left the Front unfould; That all may see who hate us, how we seek Peace and composure, and with open brest Stand readie to receive them, if they like Our overture, and turn not back perverse; But that I doubt, however witness Heaven, Heav\&amp;#39;n witness thou anon, while we discharge Freely our part; yee who appointed stand Do as you have in charge, and briefly touch What we propound, and loud that all may hear. So scoffing in ambiguous words, he scarce Had ended; when to Right and Left the Front Divided, and to either Flank retir\&amp;#39;d. Which to our eyes discoverd new and strange, A triple mounted row of Pillars laid On Wheels (for like to Pillars most they seem\&amp;#39;d Or hollow\&amp;#39;d bodies made of Oak or Firr With branches lopt, in Wood or Mountain fell\&amp;#39;d) Brass, Iron, Stonie mould, had not thir mouthes With hideous orifice gap\&amp;#39;t on us wide, Portending hollow truce; at each behind A Seraph stood, and in his hand a Reed Stood waving tipt with fire; while we suspense, Collected stood within our thoughts amus\&amp;#39;d, Not long, for sudden all at once thir Reeds Put forth, and to a narrow vent appli\&amp;#39;d With nicest touch. Immediate in a flame, But soon obscur\&amp;#39;d with smoak, all Heav\&amp;#39;n appeerd, From those deep throated Engins belcht, whose roar Emboweld with outragious noise the Air, And all her entrails tore, disgorging foule Thir devilish glut, chaind Thunderbolts and Hail Of Iron Globes, which on the Victor Host Level\&amp;#39;d, with such impetuous furie smote, That whom they hit, none on thir feet might stand, Though standing else as Rocks, but down they fell By thousands, Angel on Arch-Angel rowl\&amp;#39;d; The sooner for thir Arms, unarm\&amp;#39;d they might Have easily as Spirits evaded swift By quick contraction or remove; but now Foule dissipation follow\&amp;#39;d and forc\&amp;#39;t rout; Nor serv\&amp;#39;d it to relax thir serried files. What should they do? if on they rusht, repulse Repeated, and indecent overthrow Doubl\&amp;#39;d, would render them yet more despis\&amp;#39;d, And to thir foes a laughter; for in view Stood rankt of Seraphim another row In posture to displode thir second tire Of Thunder: back defeated to return They worse abhorr\&amp;#39;d. Satan beheld thir plight, And to his Mates thus in derision call\&amp;#39;d. O Friends, why come not on these Victors proud? Ere while they fierce were coming, and when wee, To entertain them fair with open Front And Brest, (what could we more?) propounded terms Of composition, strait they chang\&amp;#39;d thir minds, Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell, As they would dance, yet for a dance they seemd Somwhat extravagant and wilde, perhaps For joy of offerd peace: but I suppose If our proposals once again were heard We should compel them to a quick result. To whom thus Belial in like gamesom mood, Leader, the terms we sent were terms of weight, Of hard contents, and full of force urg\&amp;#39;d home, Such as we might perceive amus\&amp;#39;d them all, And stumbl\&amp;#39;d many, who receives them right, Had need from head to foot well understand; Not understood, this gift they have besides, They shew us when our foes walk not upright. So they among themselves in pleasant veine Stood scoffing, highthn\&amp;#39;d in thir thoughts beyond All doubt of Victorie, eternal might To match with thir inventions they presum\&amp;#39;d So easie, and of his Thunder made a scorn, And all his Host derided, while they stood A while in trouble; but they stood not long, Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose. Forthwith (behold the excellence, the power Which God hath in his mighty Angels plac\&amp;#39;d) Thir Arms away they threw, and to the Hills (For Earth hath this variety from Heav\&amp;#39;n Of pleasure situate in Hill and Dale) Light as the Lightning glimps they ran, they flew, From thir foundations loosning to and fro They pluckt the seated Hills with all thir load, Rocks, Waters, Woods, and by the shaggie tops Up lifting bore them in thir hands: Amaze, Be sure, and terrour seis\&amp;#39;d the rebel Host, When coming towards them so dread they saw The bottom of the Mountains upward turn\&amp;#39;d, Till on those cursed Engins triple-row They saw them whelm\&amp;#39;d, and all thir confidence Under the weight of Mountains buried deep, Themselves invaded next, and on thir heads Main Promontories flung, which in the Air Came shadowing, and opprest whole Legions arm\&amp;#39;d, Thir armor help\&amp;#39;d thir harm, crush\&amp;#39;t in and bruis\&amp;#39;d Into thir substance pent, which wrought them pain Implacable, and many a dolorous groan, Long strugling underneath, ere they could wind Out of such prison, though Spirits of purest light, Purest at first, now gross by sinning grown. The rest in imitation to like Armes Betook them, and the neighbouring Hills uptore; So Hills amid the Air encounterd Hills Hurl\&amp;#39;d to and fro with jaculation dire That under ground, they fought in dismal shade; Infernal noise; Warr seem\&amp;#39;d a civil Game To this uproar; horrid confusion heapt Upon confusion rose: and now all Heav\&amp;#39;n Had gon to wrack, with ruin overspred, Had not th\&amp;#39; Almightie Father where he sits Shrin\&amp;#39;d in his Sanctuarie of Heav\&amp;#39;n secure, Consulting on the sum of things, foreseen This tumult, and permitted all, advis\&amp;#39;d: That his great purpose he might so fulfill, To honour his Anointed Son aveng\&amp;#39;d Upon his enemies, and to declare All power on him transferr\&amp;#39;d: whence to his Son Th\&amp;#39; Assessor of his Throne he thus began. Effulgence of my Glorie, Son belov\&amp;#39;d, Son in whose face invisible is beheld Visibly, what by Deitie I am, And in whose hand what by Decree I doe, Second Omnipotence, two dayes are past, Two dayes, as we compute the dayes of Heav\&amp;#39;n, Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame These disobedient; sore hath been thir fight, As likeliest was, when two such Foes met arm\&amp;#39;d; For to themselves I left them, and thou knowst, Equal in their Creation they were form\&amp;#39;d, Save what sin hath impaird, which yet hath wrought Insensibly, for I suspend thir doom; Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last Endless, and no solution will be found: Warr wearied hath perform\&amp;#39;d what Warr can do, And to disorder\&amp;#39;d rage let loose the reines, With Mountains as with Weapons arm\&amp;#39;d, which makes Wild work in Heav\&amp;#39;n, and dangerous to the maine. Two dayes are therefore past, the third is thine; For thee I have ordain\&amp;#39;d it, and thus farr Have sufferd, that the Glorie may be thine Of ending this great Warr, since none but Thou Can end it. Into thee such Vertue and Grace Immense I have transfus\&amp;#39;d, that all may know In Heav\&amp;#39;n and Hell thy Power above compare, And this perverse Commotion governd thus, To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir Of all things, to be Heir and to be King By Sacred Unction, thy deserved right. Go then thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might, Ascend my Chariot, guide the rapid Wheeles That shake Heav\&amp;#39;ns basis, bring forth all my Warr, My Bow and Thunder, my Almightie Arms Gird on, and Sword upon thy puissant Thigh; Pursue these sons of Darkness, drive them out From all Heav\&amp;#39;ns bounds into the utter Deep: There let them learn, as likes them, to despise God and Messiah his anointed King. He said, and on his Son with Rayes direct Shon full, he all his Father full expresst Ineffably into his face receiv\&amp;#39;d, And thus the filial Godhead answering spake. O Father, O Supream of heav\&amp;#39;nly Thrones, First, Highest, Holiest, Best, thou alwayes seekst To glorifie thy Son, I alwayes thee, As is most just; this I my Glorie account, My exaltation, and my whole delight, That thou in me well pleas\&amp;#39;d, declarst thy will Fulfill\&amp;#39;d, which to fulfil is all my bliss. Scepter and Power, thy giving, I assume, And gladlier shall resign, when in the end Thou shalt be All in All, and I in thee For ever, and in mee all whom thou lov\&amp;#39;st: But whom thou hat\&amp;#39;st, I hate, and can put on Thy terrors, as I put thy mildness on, Image of thee in all things; and shall soon, Armd with thy might, rid heav\&amp;#39;n of these rebell\&amp;#39;d, To thir prepar\&amp;#39;d ill Mansion driven down To chains of darkness, and th\&amp;#39; undying Worm, That from thy just obedience could revolt, Whom to obey is happiness entire. Then shall thy Saints unmixt, and from th\&amp;#39; impure Farr separate, circling thy holy Mount Unfained Halleluiahs to thee sing, Hymns of high praise, and I among them chief. So said, he o\&amp;#39;re his Scepter bowing, rose From the right hand of Glorie where he sate, And the third sacred Morn began to shine Dawning through Heav\&amp;#39;n: forth rush\&amp;#39;d with whirlwind sound The Chariot of Paternal Deitie, Flashing thick flames, Wheele within Wheele undrawn, It self instinct with Spirit, but convoyd By four Cherubic shapes, four Faces each Had wondrous, as with Starrs thir bodies all And Wings were set with Eyes, with Eyes the wheels Of Beril, and careering Fires between; Over thir heads a chrystal Firmament, Whereon a Saphir Throne, inlaid with pure Amber, and colours of the showrie Arch. Hee in Celestial Panoplie all armd Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought, Ascended, at his right hand Victorie Sate Eagle-wing\&amp;#39;d, beside him hung his Bow And Quiver with three-bolted Thunder stor\&amp;#39;d, And from about him fierce Effusion rowld Of smoak and bickering flame, and sparkles dire; Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints, He onward came, farr off his coming shon, And twentie thousand (I thir number heard) Chariots of God, half on each hand were seen: Hee on the wings of Cherub rode sublime On the Chrystallin Skie, in Saphir Thron\&amp;#39;d. Illustrious farr and wide, but by his own First seen, them unexpected joy surpriz\&amp;#39;d, When the great Ensign of Messiah blaz\&amp;#39;d Aloft by Angels born, his Sign in Heav\&amp;#39;n: Under whose conduct Michael soon reduc\&amp;#39;d His Armie, circumfus\&amp;#39;d on either Wing, Under thir Head imbodied all in one. Before him Power Divine his way prepar\&amp;#39;d; At his command the uprooted Hills retir\&amp;#39;d Each to his place, they heard his voice and went Obsequious, Heav\&amp;#39;n his wonted face renewd, And with fresh Flourets Hill and Valley smil\&amp;#39;d. This saw his hapless Foes but stood obdur\&amp;#39;d, And to rebellious fight rallied thir Powers Insensate, hope conceiving from despair. In heav\&amp;#39;nly Spirits could such perverseness dwell? But to convince the proud what Signs availe, Or Wonders move th\&amp;#39; obdurate to relent? They hard\&amp;#39;nd more by what might most reclame, Grieving to see his Glorie, at the sight Took envie, and aspiring to his highth, Stood reimbattell\&amp;#39;d fierce, by force or fraud Weening to prosper, and at length prevaile Against God and Messiah, or to fall In universal ruin last, and now To final Battel drew, disdaining flight, Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God To all his Host on either hand thus spake. Stand still in bright array ye Saints, here stand Ye Angels arm\&amp;#39;d, this day from Battel rest; Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God Accepted, fearless in his righteous Cause, And as ye have receivd, so have ye don Invincibly; but of this cursed crew The punishment to other hand belongs, Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints; Number to this dayes work is not ordain\&amp;#39;d Nor multitude, stand onely and behold Gods indignation on these Godless pourd By mee, not you but mee they have despis\&amp;#39;d, Yet envied; against mee is all thir rage, Because the Father, t\&amp;#39; whom in Heav\&amp;#39;n supream Kingdom and Power and Glorie appertains, Hath honourd me according to his will. Therefore to mee thir doom he hath assig\&amp;#39;n\&amp;#39;d; That they may have thir wish, to trie with mee In Battel which the stronger proves, they all, Or I alone against them, since by strength They measure all, of other excellence Not emulous, nor care who them excells; Nor other strife with them do I voutsafe. So spake the Son, and into terrour chang\&amp;#39;d His count\&amp;#39;nance too severe to be beheld And full of wrauth bent on his Enemies. At once the Four spred out thir Starrie wings With dreadful shade contiguous, and the Orbes Of his fierce Chariot rowld, as with the sound Of torrent Floods, or of a numerous Host. Hee on his impious Foes right onward drove, Gloomie as Night; under his burning Wheeles The stedfast Empyrean shook throughout, All but the Throne it self of God. Full soon Among them he arriv\&amp;#39;d; in his right hand Grasping ten thousand Thunders, which he sent Before him, such as in thir Soules infix\&amp;#39;d Plagues; they astonisht all resistance lost, All courage; down thir idle weapons drop\&amp;#39;d; O\&amp;#39;re Shields and Helmes, and helmed heads he rode Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate, That wisht the Mountains now might be again Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire. Nor less on either side tempestuous fell His arrows, from the fourfold-visag\&amp;#39;d Foure, Distinct with eyes, and from the living Wheels Distinct alike with multitude of eyes, One Spirit in them rul\&amp;#39;d, and every eye Glar\&amp;#39;d lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire Among th\&amp;#39; accurst, that witherd all thir strength, And of thir wonted vigour left them draind, Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fall\&amp;#39;n. Yet half his strength he put not forth, but check\&amp;#39;d His Thunder in mid Volie, for he meant Not to destroy, but root them out of Heav\&amp;#39;n: The overthrown he rais\&amp;#39;d, and as a Heard Of Goats or timerous flock together throngd Drove them before him Thunder-struck, pursu\&amp;#39;d With terrors and with furies to the bounds And Chrystal wall of Heav\&amp;#39;n, which op\&amp;#39;ning wide, Rowld inward, and a spacious Gap disclos\&amp;#39;d Into the wastful Deep; the monstrous sight Strook them with horror backward, but far worse Urg\&amp;#39;d them behind; headlong themselves they threw Down from the verge of Heav\&amp;#39;n, Eternal wrauth Burnt after them to the bottomless pit. Hell heard th\&amp;#39; unsufferable noise, Hell saw Heav\&amp;#39;n ruining from Heav\&amp;#39;n and would have fled Affrighted; but strict Fate had cast too deep Her dark foundations, and too fast had bound. Nine dayes they fell; confounded Chaos roard, And felt tenfold confusion in thir fall Through his wilde Anarchie, so huge a rout Incumberd him with ruin: Hell at last Yawning receavd them whole, and on them clos\&amp;#39;d, Hell thir fit habitation fraught with fire Unquenchable, the house of woe and paine. Disburd\&amp;#39;nd Heav\&amp;#39;n rejoic\&amp;#39;d, and soon repaird Her mural breach, returning whence it rowld. Sole Victor from th\&amp;#39; expulsion of his Foes Messiah his triumphal Chariot turnd: To meet him all his Saints, who silent stood Eye witnesses of his Almightie Acts, With Jubilie advanc\&amp;#39;d; and as they went, Shaded with branching Palme, each order bright, Sung Triumph, and him sung Victorious King, Son, Heir, and Lord, to him Dominion giv\&amp;#39;n, Worthiest to Reign: he celebrated rode Triumphant through mid Heav\&amp;#39;n, into the Courts And Temple of his migihtie Father Thron\&amp;#39;d On high: who into Glorie him receav\&amp;#39;d, Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss. Thus measuring things in Heav\&amp;#39;n by things on Earth At thy request, and that thou maist beware By what is past, to thee I have reveal\&amp;#39;d What might have else to human Race bin hid; The discord which befel, and Warr in Heav\&amp;#39;n Among th\&amp;#39; Angelic Powers, and the deep fall Of those too high aspiring, who rebelld With Satan, hee who envies now thy state, Who now is plotting how he may seduce Thee also from obedience, that with him Bereavd of happiness thou maist partake His punishment, Eternal miserie; Which would be all his solace and revenge, As a despite don against the most High, Thee once to gaine Companion of his woe. But list\&amp;#39;n not to his Temptations, warne Thy weaker; let it profit thee to have heard By terrible Example the reward Of disobedience; firm they might have stood, Yet fell; remember, and fear to transgress.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;DEscend from Heav&amp;#39;n Urania, by that name If rightly thou art call&amp;#39;d, whose Voice divine Following, above th&amp;#39; Olympian Hill I soare, Above the flight of Pegasean wing. The meaning, not the Name I call: for thou Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top Of old Olympus dwell&amp;#39;st, but Heav&amp;#39;nlie borne, Before the Hills appeerd, or Fountain flow&amp;#39;d, Thou with Eternal wisdom didst converse, Wisdom thy Sister, and with her didst play In presence of th&amp;#39; Almightie Father, pleas&amp;#39;d With thy Celestial Song. Up led by thee Into the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heav&amp;#39;ns I have presum&amp;#39;d, An Earthlie Guest, and drawn Empyreal Aire, Thy tempring; with like safetie guided down Return me to my Native Element: Least from this flying Steed unrein&amp;#39;d, (as once Bellerophon, though from a lower Clime) Dismounted, on th&amp;#39; Aleian Field I fall Erroneous there to wander and forlorne. Half yet remaines unsung, but narrower bound Within the visible Diurnal Spheare; Standing on Earth, not rapt above the Pole, More safe I Sing with mortal voice, unchang&amp;#39;d To hoarce or mute, though fall&amp;#39;n on evil dayes, On evil dayes though fall&amp;#39;n, and evil tongues; In darkness, and with dangers compast round, And solitude; yet not alone, while thou Visit&amp;#39;st my slumbers Nightly, or when Morn Purples the East: still govern thou my Song, Urania, and fit audience find, though few. But drive farr off the barbarous dissonance Of Bacchus and his revellers, the Race Of that wilde Rout that tore the Thracian Bard In Rhodope, where Woods and Rocks had Eares To rapture, till the savage clamor dround Both Harp and Voice; nor could the Muse defend Her Son. So fail not thou, who thee implores: For thou are Heav&amp;#39;nlie, shee an emptie dreame. Say Goddess, what ensu&amp;#39;d when Raphael, The affable Arch-Angel, had forewarn&amp;#39;d Adam by dire example to beware Apostasie, by what befell in Heaven To those Apostates, least the like befall In Paradise to Adam or his Race, Charg&amp;#39;d not to touch the interdicted Tree, If they transgress, and slight that sole command, So easily obeyd amid the choice Of all tastes else to please thir appetite, Though wandring. He with his consorted Eve The storie heard attentive, and was fill&amp;#39;d With admiration, and deep Muse to hear Of things so high and strange, things to thir thought So unimaginable as hate in Heav&amp;#39;n, And Warr so neer the Peace of God in bliss With such confusion: but the evil soon Driv&amp;#39;n back redounded as a flood on those From whom it sprung, impossible to mix With Blessedness. Whence Adam soon repeal&amp;#39;d The doubts that in his heart arose: and now Led on, yet sinless, with desire to know What neerer might concern him, how this World Of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth conspicious first began, When, and whereof created, for what cause, What within Eden or without was done Before his memorie, as one whose drouth Yet scarce allay&amp;#39;d still eyes the current streame, Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites, Proceeded thus to ask his Heav&amp;#39;nly Guest. Great things, and full of wonder in our eares, Farr differing from this World, thou hast reveal&amp;#39;d Divine interpreter, by favour sent Down from the Empyrean to forewarne Us timely of what might else have bin our loss, Unknown, which human knowledg could not reach: For which to the infinitly Good we owe Immortal thanks, and his admonishment Receave with solemne purpose to observe Immutably his sovran will, the end Of what we are. But since thou hast voutsaf&amp;#39;t Gently for our instruction to impart Things above Earthly thought, which yet concernd Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemd, Deign to descend now lower, and relate What may no less perhaps availe us known, How first began this Heav&amp;#39;n which we behold Distant so high, with moving Fires adornd Innumerable, and this which yeelds or fills All space, the ambient Aire wide interfus&amp;#39;d Imbracing round this florid Earth, what cause Mov&amp;#39;d the Creator in his holy Rest Through all Eternitie so late to build In Chaos, and the work begun, how soon Absolv&amp;#39;d, if unforbid thou maist unfould What wee, not to explore the secrets aske Of his Eternal Empire, but the more To magnifie his works, the more we know. And the great Light of Day yet wants to run Much of his Race though steep, suspens in Heav&amp;#39;n Held by thy voice, thy potent voice he heares, And longer will delay to heare thee tell His Generation, and the rising Birth Of Nature from the unapparent Deep: Or if the Starr of Eevning and the Moon Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring Silence, and Sleep listning to thee will watch, Or we can bid his absence, till thy Song End, and dismiss thee ere the Morning shine. Thus Adam his illustrious Guest besought: And thus the Godlike Angel answerd milde. This also thy request with caution askt Obtaine: though to recount Almightie works What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice, Or heart of man suffice to comprehend? Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve To glorifie the Maker, and inferr Thee also happier, shall not be withheld Thy hearing, such Commission from above I have receav&amp;#39;d, to answer thy desire Of knowledge within bounds; beyond abstain To ask, nor let thine own inventions hope Things not reveal&amp;#39;d, which th&amp;#39; invisible King, Onely Omniscient, hath supprest in Night, To none communicable in Earth or Heaven: Anough is left besides to search and know. But Knowledge is as food, and needs no less Her Temperance over Appetite, to know In measure what the mind may well contain, Oppresses else with Surfet, and soon turns Wisdom to Folly, as Nourishment to Winde. Know then, that after Lucifer from Heav&amp;#39;n (So call him, brighter once amidst the Host Of Angels, then that Starr the Starrs among) Fell with his flaming Legions through the Deep Into his place, and the great Son returnd Victorious with his Saints, th&amp;#39; Omnipotent Eternal Father from his Throne beheld Thir multitude, and to his Son thus spake. At least our envious Foe hath fail&amp;#39;d, who thought All like himself rebellious, by whose aid This inaccessible high strength, the seat Of Deitie supream, us dispossest, He trusted to have seis&amp;#39;d, and into fraud Drew many, whom thir place knows here no more; Yet farr the greater part have kept, I see, Thir station, Heav&amp;#39;n yet populous retaines Number sufficient to possess her Realmes Though wide, and this high Temple to frequent With Ministeries due and solemn Rites: But least his heart exalt him in the harme Already done, to have dispeopl&amp;#39;d Heav&amp;#39;n My damage fondly deem&amp;#39;d, I can repaire That detriment, if such it be to lose Self-lost, and in a moment will create Another World, out of one man a Race Of men innumerable, there to dwell, Not here, till by degrees of merit rais&amp;#39;d They open to themselves at length the way Up hither, under long obedience tri&amp;#39;d, And Earth be chang&amp;#39;d to Heav&amp;#39;n, &amp;amp; Heav&amp;#39;n to Earth, One Kingdom, Joy and Union without end. Mean while inhabit laxe, ye Powers of Heav&amp;#39;n, And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee This I perform, speak thou, and be it don: My overshadowing Spirit and might with thee I send along, ride forth, and bid the Deep Within appointed bounds be Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, Boundless the Deep, because I am who fill Infinitude, nor vacuous the space. Though I uncircumscrib&amp;#39;d my self retire, And put not forth my goodness, which is free To act or not, Necessitie and Chance Approach not mee, and what I will is Fate. So spake th&amp;#39; Almightie, and to what he spake His Word, the filial Godhead, gave effect. Immediate are the Acts of God, more swift Then time or motion, but to human ears Cannot without process of speech be told, So told as earthly notion can receave. Great triumph and rejoycing was in Heav&amp;#39;n When such was heard declar&amp;#39;d the Almightie&amp;#39;s will; Glorie they sung to the most High, good will To future men, and in thir dwellings peace: Glorie to him whose just avenging ire Had driven out th&amp;#39; ungodly from his sight And th&amp;#39; habitations of the just; to him Glorie and praise, whose wisdom had ordain&amp;#39;d Good out of evil to create, in stead Of Spirits maligne a better Race to bring Into thir vacant room, and thence diffuse His good to Worlds and Ages infinite. So sang the Hierarchies: Mean while the Son On his great Expedition now appeer&amp;#39;d, Girt with Omnipotence, with Radiance crown&amp;#39;d Of Majestie Divine, Sapience and Love Immense, and all his Father in him shon. About his Chariot numberless were pour&amp;#39;d Cherub and Seraph, Potentates and Thrones, And Vertues, winged Spirits, and Chariots wing&amp;#39;d, From the Armoury of God, where stand of old Myriads between two brazen Mountains lodg&amp;#39;d Against a solemn day, harnest at hand, Celestial Equipage; and now came forth Spontaneous, for within them Spirit livd, Attendant on thir Lord: Heav&amp;#39;n op&amp;#39;nd wide Her ever during Gates, Harmonious sound On golden Hinges moving, to let forth The King of Glorie in his powerful Word And Spirit coming to create new Worlds. On heav&amp;#39;nly ground they stood, and from the shore They view&amp;#39;d the vast immeasurable Abyss Outrageous as a Sea, dark, wasteful, wilde, Up from the bottom turn&amp;#39;d by furious windes And surging waves, as Mountains to assault Heav&amp;#39;ns highth, and with the Center mix the Pole. Silence, ye troubl&amp;#39;d waves, and thou Deep, peace, Said then th&amp;#39; Omnific Word, your discord end: Nor staid, but on the Wings of Cherubim Uplifted, in Paternal Glorie rode Farr into Chaos, and the World unborn; For Chaos heard his voice: him all his Traine Follow&amp;#39;d in bright procession to behold Creation, and the wonders of his might. Then staid the fervid Wheeles, and in his hand He took the golden Compasses, prepar&amp;#39;d In Gods Eternal store, to circumscribe This Universe, and all created things: One foot he center&amp;#39;d, and the other turn&amp;#39;d Round through the vast profunditie obscure, And said, thus farr extend, thus farr thy bounds, This be thy just Circumference, O World. Thus God the Heav&amp;#39;n created, thus the Earth, Matter unform&amp;#39;d and void: Darkness profound Cover&amp;#39;d th&amp;#39; Abyss: but on the watrie calme His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspred, And vital vertue infus&amp;#39;d, and vital warmth Throughout the fluid Mass, but downward purg&amp;#39;d The black tartareous cold Infernal dregs Adverse to life: then founded, then conglob&amp;#39;d Like things to like, the rest to several place Disparted, and between spun out the Air, And Earth self ballanc&amp;#39;t on her Center hung. Let ther be Light, said God, and forthwith Light Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure Sprung from the Deep, and from her Native East To journie through the airie gloom began, Sphear&amp;#39;d in a radiant Cloud, for yet the Sun Was not; shee in a cloudie Tabernacle Sojourn&amp;#39;d the while. God saw the Light was good; And light from darkness by the Hemisphere Divided: Light the Day, and Darkness Night He nam&amp;#39;d. Thus was the first Day Eev&amp;#39;n and Morn: Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung By the Celestial Quires, when Orient Light Exhaling first from Darkness they beheld; Birth-day of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth; with joy and shout The hollow Universal Orb they fill&amp;#39;d, And touch&amp;#39;t thir Golden Harps, and hymning prais&amp;#39;d God and his works, Creatour him they sung, Both when first Eevning was, and when first Morn. Again, God said, let ther be Firmament Amid the Waters, and let it divide The Waters from the Waters: and God made The Firmament, expanse of liquid, pure, Transparent, Elemental Air, diffus&amp;#39;d In circuit to the uttermost convex Of this great Round: partition firm and sure, The Waters underneath from those above Dividing: for as Earth, so he the World Built on circumfluous Waters calme, in wide Crystallin Ocean, and the loud misrule Of Chaos farr remov&amp;#39;d, least fierce extreames Contiguous might distemper the whole frame: And Heav&amp;#39;n he nam&amp;#39;d the Firmament: So Eev&amp;#39;n And Morning Chorus sung the second Day. The Earth was form&amp;#39;d, but in the Womb as yet Of Waters, Embryon immature involv&amp;#39;d, Appeer&amp;#39;d not: over all the face of Earth Main Ocean flow&amp;#39;d, not idle, but with warme Prolific humour soft&amp;#39;ning all her Globe, Fermented the great Mother to conceave, Satiate with genial moisture, when God said Be gather&amp;#39;d now ye Waters under Heav&amp;#39;n Into one place, and let dry Land appeer. Immediately the Mountains huge appeer Emergent, and thir broad bare backs upheave Into the Clouds, thir tops ascend the Skie: So high as heav&amp;#39;d the tumid Hills, so low Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep, Capacious bed of Waters: thither they Hasted with glad precipitance, uprowld As drops on dust conglobing from the drie; Part rise in crystal Wall, or ridge direct, For haste; such flight the great command impress&amp;#39;d On the swift flouds: as Armies at the call Of Trumpet (for of Armies thou hast heard) Troop to thir Standard, so the watrie throng, Wave rowling after Wave, where way they found, If steep, with torrent rapture, if through Plaine, Soft-ebbing; nor withstood them Rock or Hill, But they, or under ground, or circuit wide With Serpent errour wandring, found thir way, And on the washie Oose deep Channels wore; Easie, e&amp;#39;re God had bid the ground be drie, All but within those banks, where Rivers now Stream, and perpetual draw thir humid traine. The dry Land, Earth, and the great receptacle Of congregated Waters he call&amp;#39;d Seas: And saw that it was good, and said, Let th&amp;#39; Earth Put forth the verdant Grass, Herb yielding Seed, And Fruit Tree yielding Fruit after her kind; Whose Seed is in her self upon the Earth. He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then Desert and bare, unsightly, unadorn&amp;#39;d, Brought forth the tender Grass, whose verdure clad Her Universal Face with pleasant green, Then Herbs of every leaf, that sudden flour&amp;#39;d Op&amp;#39;ning thir various colours, and made gay Her bosom smelling sweet: and these scarce blown, Forth flourish&amp;#39;t thick the clustring Vine, forth crept The smelling Gourd, up stood the cornie Reed Embattell&amp;#39;d in her field: and the humble Shrub, And Bush with frizl&amp;#39;d hair implicit: last Rose as in Dance the stately Trees, and spred Thir branches hung with copious Fruit; or gemm&amp;#39;d Thir blossoms: with high woods the hills were crownd, With tufts the vallies and each fountain side, With borders long the Rivers. That Earth now Seemd like to Heav&amp;#39;n, a seat where Gods might dwell, Or wander with delight, and love to haunt Her sacred shades: though God had yet not rain&amp;#39;d Upon the Earth, and man to till the ground None was, but from the Earth a dewie Mist Went up and waterd all the ground, and each Plant of the field, which e&amp;#39;re it was in the Earth God made, and every Herb, before it grew On the green stemm; God saw that it was good. So Eev&amp;#39;n and Morn recorded the Third Day. Again th&amp;#39; Almightie spake: Let there be Lights High in th&amp;#39; expanse of Heaven to divide The Day from Night; and let them be for Signes, For Seasons, and for Dayes, and circling Years, And let them be for Lights as I ordaine Thir Office in the Firmament of Heav&amp;#39;n To give Light on the Earth; and it was so. And God made two great Lights, great for thir use To Man, the greater to have rule by Day, The less by Night alterne: and made the Starrs, And set them in the Firmament of Heav&amp;#39;n To illuminate the Earth, and rule the Day In thir vicissitude, and rule the Night, And Light from Darkness to divide. God saw, Surveying his great Work, that it was good: For of Celestial Bodies first the Sun A mightie Spheare he fram&amp;#39;d, unlightsom first, Though of Ethereal Mould: then form&amp;#39;d the Moon Globose, and every magnitude of Starrs, And sowd with Starrs the Heav&amp;#39;n thick as a field: Of Light by farr the greater part he took, Transplanted from her cloudie Shrine, and plac&amp;#39;d In the Suns Orb, made porous to receive And drink the liquid Light, firm to retaine Her gather&amp;#39;d beams, great Palace now of Light. Hither as to thir Fountain other Starrs Repairing, in thir gold&amp;#39;n Urns draw Light, And hence the Morning Planet guilds her horns; By tincture or reflection they augment Thir small peculiar, though from human sight So farr remote, with diminution seen. First in his East the glorious Lamp was seen, Regent of Day, and all th&amp;#39; Horizon round Invested with bright Rayes, jocond to run His Longitude through Heav&amp;#39;ns high rode: the gray Dawn, and the Pleiades before him danc&amp;#39;d Shedding sweet influence: less bright the Moon, But opposite in leveld West was set His mirror, with full face borrowing her Light From him, for other light she needed none In that aspect, and still that distance keepes Till night, then in the East her turn she shines, Revolvd on Heav&amp;#39;ns great Axle, and her Reign With thousand lesser Lights dividual holds, With thousand thousand Starres, that then appeer&amp;#39;d Spangling the Hemisphere: then first adornd With thir bright Luminaries that Set and Rose, Glad Eevning and glad Morn crownd the fourth day. And God said, let the Waters generate Reptil with Spawn abundant, living Soule: And let Fowle flie above the Earth, with wings Displayd on the op&amp;#39;n Firmament of Heav&amp;#39;n. And God created the great Whales, and each Soul living, each that crept, which plenteously The waters generated by thir kindes, And every Bird of wing after his kinde; And saw that it was good, and bless&amp;#39;d them, saying, Be fruitful, multiply, and in the Seas And Lakes and running Streams the waters fill; And let the Fowle be multiply&amp;#39;d on the Earth. Forthwith the Sounds and Seas, each Creek and Bay With Frie innumerable swarme, and Shoales Of Fish that with thir Finns and shining Scales Glide under the green Wave, in Sculles that oft Bank the mid Sea: part single or with mate Graze the Sea weed thir pasture, and through Groves Of Coral stray, or sporting with quick glance Show to the Sun thir wav&amp;#39;d coats dropt with Gold, Or in thir Pearlie shells at ease, attend Moist nutriment, or under Rocks thir food In jointed Armour watch: on smooth the Seale, And bended Dolphins play: part huge of bulk Wallowing unweildie, enormous in thir Gate Tempest the Ocean: there Leviathan Hugest of living Creatures, on the Deep Stretcht like a Promontorie sleeps or swimmes, And seems a moving Land, and at his Gilles Draws in, and at his Trunck spouts out a Sea. Mean while the tepid Caves, and Fens and shoares Thir Brood as numerous hatch, from the Egg that soon Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclos&amp;#39;d Thir callow young, but featherd soon and fledge They summ&amp;#39;d thir Penns, and soaring th&amp;#39; air sublime With clang despis&amp;#39;d the ground, under a cloud In prospect; there the Eagle and the Stork On Cliffs and Cedar tops thir Eyries build: Part loosly wing the Region, part more wise In common, rang&amp;#39;d in figure wedge thir way, Intelligent of seasons, and set forth Thir Aierie Caravan high over Sea&amp;#39;s Flying, and over Lands with mutual wing Easing thir flight; so stears the prudent Crane Her annual Voiage, born on Windes; the Aire Floats, as they pass, fann&amp;#39;d with unnumber&amp;#39;d plumes: From Branch to Branch the smaller Birds with song So1ac&amp;#39;d the Woods, and spred thir painted wings Till Ev&amp;#39;n, nor then the solemn Nightingal Ceas&amp;#39;d warbling, but all night tun&amp;#39;d her soft layes: Others on Silver Lakes and Rivers Bath&amp;#39;d Thir downie Brest; the Swan with Arched neck Between her white wings mantling proudly, Rowes Her state with Oarie feet: yet oft they quit The Dank, and rising on stiff Pennons, towre The mid Aereal Skie: Others on ground Walk&amp;#39;d firm; the crested Cock whose clarion sounds The silent hours, and th&amp;#39; other whose gay Traine Adorns him, colour&amp;#39;d with the Florid hue Of Rainbows and Starrie Eyes. The Waters thus With Fish replenisht, and the Aire with Fowle, Ev&amp;#39;ning and Morn solemniz&amp;#39;d the Fift day. The Sixt, and of Creation last arose With Eevning Harps and Mattin, when God said, Let th&amp;#39; Earth bring forth Foul living in her kinde, Cattel and Creeping things, and Beast of the Earth, Each in their kinde. The Earth obey&amp;#39;d, and strait Op&amp;#39;ning her fertil Woomb teem&amp;#39;d at a Birth Innumerous living Creatures, perfet formes, Limb&amp;#39;d and full grown: out of the ground up rose As from his Laire the wilde Beast where he wonns In Forrest wilde, in Thicket, Brake, or Den; Among the Trees in Pairs they rose, they walk&amp;#39;d: The Cattel in the Fields and Meddowes green: Those rare and solitarie, these in flocks Pasturing at once, and in broad Herds upsprung. The grassie Clods now Calv&amp;#39;d, now half appeer&amp;#39;d The Tawnie Lion, pawing to get free His hinder parts, then springs as broke from Bonds, And Rampant shakes his Brinded main; the Ounce, The Libbard, and the Tyger, as the Moale Rising, the crumbl&amp;#39;d Earth above them threw In Hillocks; the swift Stag from under ground Bore up his branching head: scarse from his mould Behemoth biggest born of Earth upheav&amp;#39;d His vastness: Fleec&amp;#39;t the Flocks and bleating rose, As Plants: ambiguous between Sea and Land The River Horse and scalie Crocodile. At once came forth whatever creeps the ground, Insect or Worme; those wav&amp;#39;d thir limber fans For wings, and smallest Lineaments exact In all the Liveries dect of Summers pride With spots of Gold and Purple, azure and green: These as a line thir long dimension drew, Streaking the ground with sinuous trace; not all Minims of Nature; some of Serpent kinde Wondrous in length and corpulence involv&amp;#39;d Thir Snakie foulds, and added wings. First crept The Parsimonious Emmet, provident Of future, in small room large heart enclos&amp;#39;d, Pattern of just equalitie perhaps Hereafter, join&amp;#39;d in her popular Tribes Of Commonaltie: swarming next appeer&amp;#39;d The Female Bee that feeds her Husband Drone Deliciously, and builds her waxen Cells With Honey stor&amp;#39;d: the rest are numberless, And thou thir Natures know&amp;#39;st, &amp;amp; gav&amp;#39;st them Names, Needless to thee repeated; nor unknown The Serpent suttl&amp;#39;st Beast of all the field, Of huge extent somtimes, with brazen Eyes And hairie Main terrific, though to thee Not noxious, but obedient at thy call. Now Heav&amp;#39;n in all her Glorie shon, and rowld Her motions, as the great first Movers hand First wheeld thir course; Earth in her rich attire Consummate lovly smil&amp;#39;d; Aire, Water, Earth, By Fowl, Fish, Beast, was flown, was swum, was walkt Frequent; and of the Sixt day yet remain&amp;#39;d; There wanted yet the Master work, the end Of all yet don; a Creature who not prone And Brute as other Creatures, but endu&amp;#39;d With Sanctitie of Reason, might erect His Stature, and upright with Front serene Govern the rest, self-knowing, and from thence Magnanimous to correspond with Heav&amp;#39;n, But grateful to acknowledge whence his good Descends, thither with heart and voice and eyes Directed in Devotion, to adore And worship God Supream, who made him chief Of all his works; therefore the Omnipotent Eternal Father (For where is not hee Present) thus to his Son audibly spake. Let us make now Man in our image, Man In our similitude, and let them rule Over the Fish and Fowle of Sea and Aire, Beast of the Field, and over all the Earth, And every creeping thing that creeps the ground. This said, he formd thee, Adam, thee O Man Dust of the ground, and in thy nostrils breath&amp;#39;d The breath of Life; in his own Image hee Created thee, in the Image of God Express, and thou becam&amp;#39;st a living Soul. Male he created thee, but thy consort Female for Race; then bless&amp;#39;d Mankinde, and said, Be fruitful, multiplie, and fill the Earth, Subdue it, and throughout Dominion hold Over Fish of the Sea, and Fowle of the Aire, And every living thing that moves on the Earth. Wherever thus created, for no place Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knows&amp;#39;t He brought thee into this delicious Grove, This Garden, planted with the Trees of God, Delectable both to behold and taste; And freely all thir pleasant fruit for food Gave thee, all sorts are here that all th&amp;#39; Earth yields, Varietie without end; but of the Tree Which tasted works knowledge of Good and Evil, Thou mai&amp;#39;st not; in the day thou eat&amp;#39;st, thou di&amp;#39;st; Death is the penaltie impos&amp;#39;d, beware, And govern well thy appetite, least sin Surprise thee, and her black attendant Death. Here finish&amp;#39;d hee, and all that he had made View&amp;#39;d, and behold all was entirely good; So Ev&amp;#39;n and Morn accomplish&amp;#39;d the Sixt day: Yet not till the Creator from his work Desisting, though unwearied, up returnd Up to the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heav&amp;#39;ns his high abode, Thence to behold this new created World Th&amp;#39; addition of his Empire, how it shew&amp;#39;d In prospect from his Throne, how good, how faire, Answering his great Idea. Up he rode Followd with acclamation and the sound Symphonious of ten thousand Harpes that tun&amp;#39;d Angelic harmonies: the Earth, the Aire Resounded, (thou remember&amp;#39;st, for thou heardst) The Heav&amp;#39;ns and all the Constellations rung, The Planets in thir station list&amp;#39;ning stood, While the bright Pomp ascended jubilant. Open, ye everlasting Gates, they sung, Open, ye Heav&amp;#39;ns, your living dores; let in The great Creator from his work returnd Magnificent, his Six days work, a World; Open, and henceforth oft; for God will deigne To visit oft the dwellings of just Men Delighted, and with frequent intercourse Thither will send his winged Messengers On errands of supernal Grace. So sung The glorious Train ascending: He through Heav&amp;#39;n, That open&amp;#39;d wide her blazing Portals, led To Gods Eternal house direct the way, A broad and ample rode, whose dust is Gold And pavement Starrs, as Starrs to thee appeer, Seen in the Galaxie, that Milkie way Which nightly as a circling Zone thou seest Pouderd with Starrs. And now on Earth the Seventh Eev&amp;#39;ning arose in Eden, for the Sun Was set, and twilight from the East came on, Forerunning Night; when at the holy mount Of Heav&amp;#39;ns high-seated top, th&amp;#39; Impereal Throne Of Godhead, fixt for ever firm and sure, The Filial Power arriv&amp;#39;d, and sate him down With his great Father (for he also went Invisible, yet staid (such priviledge Hath Omnipresence) and the work ordain&amp;#39;d, Author and end of all things, and from work Now resting, bless&amp;#39;d and hallowd the Seav&amp;#39;nth day, As resting on that day from all his work, But not in silence holy kept; the Harp Had work and rested not, the solemn Pipe, And Dulcimer, all Organs of sweet stop, All sounds on Fret by String or Golden Wire Temper&amp;#39;d sort Tunings, intermixt with Voice Choral or Unison: of incense Clouds Fuming from Golden Censers hid the Mount. Creation and the Six dayes acts they sung, Great are thy works, Jehovah, infinite Thy power; what thought can measure thee or tongue Relate thee; greater now in thy return Then from the Giant Angels; thee that day Thy Thunders magnifi&amp;#39;d; but to create Is greater then created to destroy. Who can impair thee, mighty King, or bound Thy Empire? easily the proud attempt Of Spirits apostat and thir Counsels vaine Thou hast repeld, while impiously they thought Thee to diminish, and from thee withdraw The number of thy worshippers. Who seekes To lessen thee, against his purpose serves To manifest the more thy might: his evil Thou usest, and from thence creat&amp;#39;st more good. Witness this new-made World, another Heav&amp;#39;n From Heaven Gate not farr, founded in view On the cleer Hyaline, the Glassie Sea; Of amplitude almost immense, with Starr&amp;#39;s Numerous, and every Starr perhaps a World Of destind habitation; but thou know&amp;#39;st Thir seasons: among these the seat of men, Earth with her nether Ocean circumfus&amp;#39;d, Thir pleasant dwelling place. Thrice happie men, And sons of men, whom God hath thus advanc&amp;#39;t, Created in his Image, there to dwell And worship him, and in reward to rule Over his Works, on Earth, in Sea, or Air, And multiply a Race of Worshippers Holy and just: thrice happie if they know Thir happiness, and persevere upright. So sung they, and the Empyrean rung, With Halleluiahs: Thus was Sabbath kept. And thy request think now fulfill&amp;#39;d, that ask&amp;#39;d How first this World and face of things began, And what before thy memorie was don From the beginning, that posteritie Informd by thee might know; if else thou seekst Aught, not surpassing human measure, say.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;THE Angel ended, and in Adams Eare So Charming left his voice, that he a while Thought him still speaking, still stood fixt to hear; Then as new wak&amp;#39;t thus gratefully repli&amp;#39;d. What thanks sufficient, or what recompence Equal have I to render thee, Divine Hystorian, who thus largely hast allayd The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsaf&amp;#39;t This friendly condescention to relate Things else by me unsearchable, now heard With wonder, but delight, and, as is due, With glorie attributed to the high Creator; something yet of doubt remaines, Which onely thy solution can resolve. When I behold this goodly Frame, this World Of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth consisting, and compute, Thir magnitudes, this Earth a spot, a graine, An Atom, with the Firmament compar&amp;#39;d And all her numberd Starrs, that seem to rowle Spaces incomprehensible (for such Thir distance argues and thir swift return Diurnal) meerly to officiate light Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot, One day and night; in all thir vast survey Useless besides, reasoning I oft admire, How Nature wise and frugal could commit Such disproportions, with superfluous hand So many nobler Bodies to create, Greater so manifold to this one use, For aught appeers, and on thir Orbs impose Such restless revolution day by day Repeated, while the sedentarie Earth, That better might with farr less compass move, Serv&amp;#39;d by more noble then her self, attaines Her end without least motion, and receaves, As Tribute such a sumless journey brought Of incorporeal speed, her warmth and light; Speed, to describe whose swiftness Number failes. So spake our Sire, and by his count&amp;#39;nance seemd Entring on studious thoughts abstruse, which Eve Perceaving where she sat retir&amp;#39;d in sight, With lowliness Majestic from her seat, And Grace that won who saw to wish her stay, Rose, and went forth among her Fruits and Flours, To visit how they prosper&amp;#39;d, bud and bloom, Her Nurserie; they at her coming sprung And toucht by her fair tendance gladlier grew. Yet went she not, as not with such discourse Delighted, or not capable her eare Of what was high: such pleasure she reserv&amp;#39;d, Adam relating, she sole Auditress; Her Husband the Relater she preferr&amp;#39;d Before the Angel, and of him to ask Chose rather; hee, she knew would intermix Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute With conjugal Caresses, from his Lip Not Words alone pleas&amp;#39;d her. O when meet now Such pairs, in Love and mutual Honour joyn&amp;#39;d? With Goddess-like demeanour forth she went; Not unattended, for on her as Queen A pomp of winning Graces waited still, And from about her shot Darts of desire Into all Eyes to wish her still in sight. And Raphael now to Adam&amp;#39;s doubt propos&amp;#39;d Benevolent and facil thus repli&amp;#39;d. To ask or search I blame thee not, for Heav&amp;#39;n Is as the Book of God before thee set, Wherein to read his wondrous Works, and learne His Seasons, Hours, or Dayes, or Months, or Yeares: This to attain, whether Heav&amp;#39;n move or Earth, Imports not, if thou reck&amp;#39;n right, the rest From Man or Angel the great Architect Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge His secrets to be scann&amp;#39;d by them who ought Rather admire; or if they list to try Conjecture, he his Fabric of the Heav&amp;#39;ns Hath left to thir disputes, perhaps to move His laughter at thir quaint Opinions wide Hereafter, when they come to model Heav&amp;#39;n And calculate the Starrs, how they will weild The mightie frame, how build, unbuild, contrive To save appeerances, how gird the Sphear With Centric and Eccentric scribl&amp;#39;d o&amp;#39;re, Cycle and Epicycle, Orb in Orb: Alreadie by thy reasoning this I guess, Who art to lead thy ofspring, and supposest That bodies bright and greater should not serve The less not bright, nor Heav&amp;#39;n such journies run, Earth sitting still, when she alone receaves The benefit: consider first, that Great Or Bright inferrs not Excellence: the Earth Though, in comparison of Heav&amp;#39;n, so small, Nor glistering, may of solid good containe More plenty then the Sun that barren shines Whose vertue on it self workes no effect, But in the fruitful Earth; there first receavd His beams, unactive else, thir vigour find. Yet not to Earth are those bright Luminaries Officious, but to thee Earths habitant. And for the Heav&amp;#39;ns wide Circuit, let it speak The Makers high magnificence, who built So spacious, and his Line stretcht out so farr; That Man may know he dwells not in his own; An Edifice too large for him to fill, Lodg&amp;#39;d in a small partition, and the rest Ordain&amp;#39;d for uses to his Lord best known. The swiftness of those Circles attribute Though numberless, to his Omnipotence, That to corporeal substances could adde Speed almost Spiritual; mee thou thinkst not slow, Who since the Morning hour set out from Heav&amp;#39;n Where God resides, and ere mid-day arriv&amp;#39;d In Eden, distance inexpressible By Numbers that have name. But this I urge, Admitting Motion in the Heav&amp;#39;ns, to shew Invalid that which thee to doubt it mov&amp;#39;d; Not that I so affirm, though so it seem To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth. God to remove his wayes from human sense, Plac&amp;#39;d Heav&amp;#39;n from Earth so farr, that earthly sight, If it presume, might erre in things too high, And no advantage gaine. What if the Sun Be Center to the World, and other Starrs By his attractive vertue and thir own Incited, dance about him various rounds? Thir wandring course now high, now low, then hid, Progressive, retrograde, or standing still, In six thou seest, and what if sev&amp;#39;nth to these The Planet Earth, so stedfast though she seem, Insensibly three different Motions move? Which else to several Sphears thou must ascribe, Mov&amp;#39;d contrarie with thwart obliquities, Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift Nocturnal and Diurnal rhomb suppos&amp;#39;d, Invisible else above all Starrs, the Wheele Of Day and Night; which needs not thy beleefe, If Earth industrious of her self fetch Day Travelling East, and with her part averse From the Suns beam meet Night, her other part Still luminous by his ray. What if that light Sent from her through the wide transpicuous aire, To the terrestrial Moon be as a Starr Enlightning her by Day, as she by Night This Earth? reciprocal, if Land be there, Feilds and Inhabitants: Her spots thou seest As Clouds, and Clouds may rain, and Rain produce Fruits in her soft&amp;#39;nd Soile, for some to eate Allotted there; and other Suns perhaps With thir attendant Moons thou wilt descrie Communicating Male and Femal Light, Which two great Sexes animate the World, Stor&amp;#39;d in each Orb perhaps with some that live. For such vast room in Nature unpossest By living Soule, desert and desolate, Onely to shine, yet scarce to contribute Each Orb a glimps of Light, conveyd so farr Down to this habitable, which returnes Light back to them, is obvious to dispute. But whether thus these things, or whether not, Whether the Sun predominant in Heav&amp;#39;n Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun Hee from the East his flaming rode begin, Or Shee from West her silent course advance With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps On her soft Axle, while she paces Eev&amp;#39;n, And beares thee soft with the smooth Air along, Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid, Leave them to God above, him serve and feare; Of other Creatures, as him pleases best, Wherever plac&amp;#39;t, let him dispose: joy thou In what he gives to thee, this Paradise And thy faire Eve; Heav&amp;#39;n is for thee too high To know what passes there; be lowlie wise:. Think onely what concernes thee and thy being; Dream not of other Worlds, what Creatures there Live, in what state, condition or degree, Contented that thus farr hath been reveal&amp;#39;d Not of Earth onely but of highest Heav&amp;#39;n. To whom thus Adam cleerd of doubt, repli&amp;#39;d. How fully hast thou satisfi&amp;#39;d mee, pure Intelligence of Heav&amp;#39;n, Angel serene, And freed from intricacies, taught to live, The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts To interrupt the sweet of Life, from which God hath bid dwell farr off all anxious cares, And not molest us, unless we our selves Seek them with wandring thoughts, and notions vain. But apt the Mind or Fancie is to roave Uncheckt, and of her roaving is no end; Till warn&amp;#39;d, or by experience taught, she learne, That not to know at large of things remote From use, obscure and suttle, but to know That which before us lies in daily life, Is the prime Wisdom, what is more, is fume, Or emptiness, or fond impertinence, And renders us in things that most concerne Unpractis&amp;#39;d, unprepar&amp;#39;d, and still to seek. Therefore from this high pitch let us descend A lower flight, and speak of things at hand Useful, whence haply mention may arise Of somthing not unseasonable to ask By sufferance, and thy wonted favour deign&amp;#39;d. Thee I have heard relating what was don Ere my remembrance: now hear mee relate My Storie, which perhaps thou hast not heard; And Day is yet not spent; till then thou seest How suttly to detaine thee I devise, Inviting thee to hear while I relate, Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply: For while I sit with thee, I seem in Heav&amp;#39;n, And sweeter thy discourse is to my eare Then Fruits of Palm-tree pleasantest to thirst And hunger both, from labour, at the houre Of sweet repast; they satiate, and soon fill, Though pleasant, but thy words with Grace Divine Imbu&amp;#39;d, bring to thir sweetness no satietie. To whom thus Raphael answer&amp;#39;d heav&amp;#39;nly meek. Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men, Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee Abundantly his gifts hath also pour&amp;#39;d Inward and outward both, his image faire: Speaking or mute all comliness and grace Attends thee, and each word, each motion formes, Nor less think wee in Heav&amp;#39;n of thee on Earth Then of our fellow servant, and inquire Gladly into the wayes of God with Man: For God we see hath honour&amp;#39;d thee, and set On Man his Equal Love: say therefore on; For I that Day was absent, as befell, Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure, Farr on excursion toward the Gates of Hell; Squar&amp;#39;d in full Legion (such command we had) To see that none thence issu&amp;#39;d forth a spie, Or enemie, while God was in his work, Least hee incenst at such eruption bold, Destruction with Creation might have mixt. Not that they durst without his leave attempt, But us he sends upon his high behests For state, as Sovran King, and to enure Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut The dismal Gates, and barricado&amp;#39;d strong; But long ere our approaching heard within Noise, other then the sound of Dance or Song, Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage. Glad we return&amp;#39;d up to the coasts of Light Ere Sabbath Eev&amp;#39;ning: so we had in charge. But thy relation now; for I attend, Pleas&amp;#39;d with thy words no less then thou with mine. So spake the Godlike Power, and thus our Sire. For Man to tell how human Life began Is hard; for who himself beginning knew? Desire with thee still longer to converse Induc&amp;#39;d me. As new wak&amp;#39;t from soundest sleep Soft on the flourie herb I found me laid In Balmie Sweat, which with his Beames the Sun Soon dri&amp;#39;d, and on the reaking moisture fed. Strait toward Heav&amp;#39;n my wondring Eyes I turnd, And gaz&amp;#39;d a while the ample Skie, till rais&amp;#39;d By quick instinctive motion up I sprung, As thitherward endevoring, and upright Stood on my feet; about me round I saw Hill, Dale, and shadie Woods, and sunnie Plaines, And liquid Lapse of murmuring Streams; by these, Creatures that livd, and movd, and walk&amp;#39;d, or flew, Birds on the branches warbling; all things smil&amp;#39;d, With fragrance and with joy my heart oreflow&amp;#39;d. My self I then perus&amp;#39;d, and Limb by Limb Survey&amp;#39;d, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran With supple joints, and lively vigour led: But who I was, or where, or from what cause, Knew not; to speak I tri&amp;#39;d, and forthwith spake My Tongue obey&amp;#39;d and readily could name What e&amp;#39;re I saw. Thou Sun, said I, faire Light, And thou enlight&amp;#39;nd Earth, so fresh and gay, Ye Hills and Dales, ye Rivers, Woods, and Plaines, And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell, Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here? Not of my self; by some great Maker then, In goodness and in power praeeminent; Tell me, how may I know him, how adore, From whom I have that thus I move and live, And feel that I am happier then I know. While thus I call&amp;#39;d, and stray&amp;#39;d I knew not whither, From where I first drew Aire, and first beheld This happie Light, when answer none return&amp;#39;d, On a green shadie Bank profuse of Flours Pensive I sate me down; there gentle sleep First found me, and with soft oppression seis&amp;#39;d My droused sense, untroubl&amp;#39;d, though I thought I then was passing to my former state Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve: When suddenly stood at my Head a dream, Whose inward apparition gently mov&amp;#39;d My fancy to believe I yet had being, And livd: One came, methought, of shape Divine, And said, thy Mansion wants thee, Adam, rise, First Man, of Men innumerable ordain&amp;#39;d First Father, call&amp;#39;d by thee I come thy Guide To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepar&amp;#39;d. So saying, by the hand he took me rais&amp;#39;d, And over Fields and Waters, as in Aire Smooth sliding without step, last led me up A woodie Mountain; whose high top was plaine, A Circuit wide, enclos&amp;#39;d, with goodliest Trees Planted, with Walks, and Bowers, that what I saw Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemd. Each Tree Load&amp;#39;n with fairest Fruit that hung to the Eye Tempting, stirr&amp;#39;d in me sudden appetite To pluck and eate; whereat I wak&amp;#39;d, and found Before mine Eyes all real, as the dream Had lively shadowd: Here had new begun My wandring, had not hee who was my Guide Up hither, from among the Trees appeer&amp;#39;d Presence Divine. Rejoycing, but with aw In adoration at his feet I fell Submiss: he rear&amp;#39;d me, and Whom thou soughtst I am, Said mildely, Author of all this thou seest Above, or round about thee or beneath. This Paradise I give thee, count it thine To Till and keep, and of the Fruit to eate: Of every Tree that in the Garden growes Eate freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth: But of the Tree whose operation brings Knowledg of good and ill, which I have set The Pledge of thy Obedience and thy Faith Amid the Garden by the Tree of Life Remember what I warne thee, shun to taste, And shun the bitter consequence: for know, The day thou eat&amp;#39;st thereof, my sole command Transgrest, inevitably thou shalt dye; From that day mortal, and this happie State Shalt loose, expell&amp;#39;d from hence into a World Of woe and sorrow. Sternly he pronounc&amp;#39;d The rigid interdiction, which resounds Yet dreadful in mine eare, though in my choice Not to incur; but soon his cleer aspect Return&amp;#39;d and gracious purpose thus renew&amp;#39;d. Not onely these fair bounds, but all the Earth To thee and to thy Race I give; as Lords Possess it, and all things that therein live, Or live in Sea, or Aire, Beast, Fish, and Fowle. In signe whereof each Bird and Beast behold After thir kindes; I bring them to receave From thee thir Names, and pay thee fealtie With low subjection; understand the same Of Fish within thir watry residence, Not hither summond, since they cannot change Thir Element to draw the thinner Aire. As thus he spake, each Bird and Beast behold Approaching two and two, These cowring low With blandishment, each Bird stoop&amp;#39;d on his wing. I nam&amp;#39;d them, as they pass&amp;#39;d, and understood Thir Nature, with such knowledg God endu&amp;#39;d My sudden apprehension: but in these I found not what me thought I wanted still; And to the Heav&amp;#39;nly vision thus presum&amp;#39;d. O by what Name, for thou above all these, Above mankinde, or aught then mankinde higher, Surpassest farr my naming, how may I Adore thee, Author of this Universe, And all this good to man, for whose well being So amply, and with hands so liberal Thou hast provided all things: but with mee I see not who partakes. In solitude What happiness, who can enjoy alone, Or all enjoying, what contentment find? Thus I presumptuous; and the vision bright, As with a smile more bright&amp;#39;nd, thus repli&amp;#39;d. What call&amp;#39;st thou solitude, is not the Earth With various living creatures, and the Aire Replenisht, and all these at thy command To come and play before thee, know&amp;#39;st thou not Thir language and thir wayes, they also know, And reason not contemptibly; with these Find pastime, and beare rule; thy Realm is large. So spake the Universal Lord, and seem&amp;#39;d So ordering. I with leave of speech implor&amp;#39;d, And humble deprecation thus repli&amp;#39;d. Let not my words offend thee, Heav&amp;#39;nly Power, My Maker, be propitious while I speak. Hast thou not made me here thy substitute, And these inferiour farr beneath me set? Among unequals what societie Can sort, what harmonie or true delight? Which must be mutual, in proportion due Giv&amp;#39;n and receiv&amp;#39;d; but in disparitie The one intense, the other still remiss Cannot well suite with either, but soon prove Tedious alike: Of fellowship I speak Such as I seek, fit to participate All rational delight, wherein the brute Cannot be human consort; they rejoyce Each with thir kinde, Lion with Lioness; So fitly them in pairs thou hast combin&amp;#39;d; Much less can Bird with Beast, or Fish with Fowle So well converse, nor with the Ox the Ape; Wors then can Man with Beast, and least of all. Whereto th&amp;#39; Almighty answer&amp;#39;d, not displeas&amp;#39;d. A nice and suttle happiness I see Thou to thy self proposest, in the choice Of thy Associates, Adam, and wilt taste No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitarie. What thinkst thou then of mee, and this my State, Seem I to thee sufficiently possest Of happiness, or not? who am alone From all Eternitie, for none I know Second to me or like, equal much less. How have I then with whom to hold converse Save with the Creatures which I made, and those To me inferiour, infinite descents Beneath what other Creatures are to thee? He ceas&amp;#39;d, I lowly answer&amp;#39;d. To attaine The highth and depth of thy Eternal wayes All human thoughts come short, Supream of things; Thou in thy self art perfet, and in thee Is no deficience found; not so is Man, But in degree, the cause of his desire By conversation with his like to help, Or solace his defects. No need that thou Shouldst propagat, already infinite; And through all numbers absolute, though One; But Man by number is to manifest His single imperfection, and beget Like of his like, his Image multipli&amp;#39;d, In unitie defective, which requires Collateral love, and deerest amitie. Thou in thy secresie although alone, Best with thy self accompanied, seek&amp;#39;st not Social communication, yet so pleas&amp;#39;d, Canst raise thy Creature to what highth thou wilt Of Union or Communion, deifi&amp;#39;d; I by conversing cannot these erect From prone, nor in thir wayes complacence find. Thus I embold&amp;#39;nd spake, and freedom us&amp;#39;d Permissive, and acceptance found, which gain&amp;#39;d This answer from the gratious voice Divine. Thus farr to try thee, Adam, I was pleas&amp;#39;d, And finde thee knowing not of Beasts alone, Which thou hast rightly nam&amp;#39;d, but of thy self, Expressing well the spirit within thee free, My Image, not imparted to the Brute, Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike, And be so minded still; I, ere thou spak&amp;#39;st, Knew it not good for Man to be alone, And no such companie as then thou saw&amp;#39;st Intended thee, for trial onely brought, To see how thou could&amp;#39;st judge of fit and meet: What next I bring shall please thee, be assur&amp;#39;d, Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self, Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire. Hee ended, or I heard no more, for now My earthly by his Heav&amp;#39;nly overpowerd, Which it had long stood under, streind to the highth In that celestial Colloquie sublime, As with an object that excels the sense, Dazl d and spent, sunk down, and sought repair Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, call&amp;#39;d By Nature as in aide, and clos&amp;#39;d mine eyes. Mine eyes he clos&amp;#39;d, but op&amp;#39;n left the Cell Of Fancie my internal sight, by which Abstract as in a transe methought I saw, Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the shape Still glorious before whom awake I stood; Who stooping op&amp;#39;nd my left side, and took From thence a Rib, with cordial spirits warme, And Life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound, But suddenly with flesh fill&amp;#39;d up and heal&amp;#39;d: The Rib he formd and fashond with his hands; Under his forming hands a Creature grew, Manlike, but different Sex, so lovly faire, That what seemd fair in all the World, seemd now Mean, or in her summd up, in her containd And in her looks, which from that time infus&amp;#39;d Sweetness into my heart, unfelt before, And into all things from her Aire inspir&amp;#39;d The spirit of love and amorous delight. Shee disappeerd, and left me dark, I wak&amp;#39;d To find her, or for ever to deplore Her loss, and other pleasures all abjure: When out of hope, behold her, not farr off, Such as I saw her in my dream, adornd With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow To make her amiable: On she came, Led by her Heav&amp;#39;nly Maker, though unseen, And guided by his voice, nor uninformd Of nuptial Sanctitie and marriage Rites: Grace was in all her steps, Heav&amp;#39;n in her Eye, In every gesture dignitie and love. I overjoyd could not forbear aloud. This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfill&amp;#39;d Thy words, Creator bounteous and benigne, Giver of all things faire, but fairest this Of all thy gifts, nor enviest. I now see Bone of my Bone, Flesh of my Flesh, my Self Before me; Woman is her Name, of Man Extracted; for this cause he shall forgoe Father and Mother, and to his Wife adhere; And they shall be one Flesh, one Heart, one Soule. She heard me thus, and though divinely brought, Yet Innocence and Virgin Modestie, Her vertue and the conscience of her worth, That would be woo&amp;#39;d, and not unsought be won, Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retir&amp;#39;d, The more desirable, or to say all, Nature her self, though pure of sinful thought, Wrought in her so, that seeing me, she turn&amp;#39;d; I follow&amp;#39;d her, she what was Honour knew, And with obsequious Majestie approv&amp;#39;d My pleaded reason. To the Nuptial Bowre I led her blushing like the Morn: all Heav&amp;#39;n, And happie Constellations on that houre Shed thir selectest influence; the Earth Gave sign of gratulation, and each Hill; Joyous the Birds; fresh Gales and gentle Aires Whisper&amp;#39;d it to the Woods, and from thir wings Flung Rose, flung Odours from the spicie Shrub, Disporting, till the amorous Bird of Night Sung Spousal, and bid haste the Eevning Starr On his Hill top, to light the bridal Lamp. Thus I have told thee all my State, and brought My Storie to the sum of earthly bliss Which I enjoy, and must confess to find In all things else delight indeed, but such As us&amp;#39;d or not, works in the mind no change, Nor vehement desire, these delicacies I mean of Taste, Sight, Smell, Herbs, Fruits, and Flours, Walks, and the melodie of Birds; but here Farr otherwise, transported I behold, Transported touch; here passion first I felt, Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else Superiour and unmov&amp;#39;d, here onely weake Against the charm of Beauties powerful glance. Or Nature faild in mee, and left some part Not proof enough such Object to sustain, Or from my side subducting, took perhaps More then enough; at least on her bestow&amp;#39;d Too much of Ornament, in outward shew Elaborate, of inward less exact. For well I understand in the prime end Of Nature her th&amp;#39; inferiour, in the mind And inward Faculties, which most excell, In outward also her resembling less His Image who made both, and less expressing The character of that Dominion giv&amp;#39;n O&amp;#39;re other Creatures; yet when I approach Her loveliness, so absolute she seems And in her self compleat, so well to know Her own, that what she wills to do or say, Seems wisest, vertuousest, discreetest, best; All higher knowledge in her presence falls Degraded, Wisdom in discourse with her Looses discount&amp;#39;nanc&amp;#39;t, and like folly shewes; Authority and Reason on her waite, As one intended first, not after made Occasionally; and to consummate all, Greatness of mind and nobleness thir seat Build in her loveliest, and create an awe About her, as a guard Angelic plac&amp;#39;t. To whom the Angel with contracted brow. Accuse not Nature, she hath don her part; Do thou but thine, and be not diffident Of Wisdom, she deserts thee not, if thou Dismiss not her, when most thou needst her nigh, By attributing overmuch to things Less excellent, as thou thy self perceav&amp;#39;st. For what admir&amp;#39;st thou, what transports thee so, An outside? fair no doubt, and worthy well Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love, Not thy subjection: weigh with her thy self; Then value: Oft times nothing profits more Then self esteem, grounded on just and right Well manag&amp;#39;d; of that skill the more thou know&amp;#39;st, The more she will acknowledge thee her Head, And to realities yield all her shows: Made so adorn for thy delight the more, So awful, that with honour thou maist love Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise. But if the sense of touch whereby mankind Is propagated seem such dear delight Beyond all other, think the same voutsaf&amp;#39;t To Cattel and each Beast; which would not be To them made common and divulg&amp;#39;d, if aught Therein enjoy&amp;#39;d were worthy to subdue The Soule of Man, or passion in him move. What higher in her societie thou findst Attractive, human, rational, love still; In loving thou dost well, in passion not, Wherein true Love consists not; love refines The thoughts, and heart enlarges, hath his seat In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale By which to heav&amp;#39;nly Love thou maist ascend, Not sunk in carnal pleasure, for which cause Among the Beasts no Mate for thee was found. To whom thus half abash&amp;#39;t Adam repli&amp;#39;d. Neither her out-side formd so fair, nor aught In procreation common to all kindes (Though higher of the genial Bed by far, And with mysterious reverence I deem) So much delights me as those graceful acts, Those thousand decencies that daily flow From all her words and actions mixt with Love And sweet compliance, which declare unfeign&amp;#39;d Union of Mind, or in us both one Soule; Harmonie to behold in wedded pair More grateful then harmonious sound to the eare. Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose What inward thence I feel, not therefore foild, Who meet with various objects, from the sense Variously representing; yet still free Approve the best, and follow what I approve. To love thou blam&amp;#39;st me not, for love thou saist Leads up to Heav&amp;#39;n, is both the way and guide; Bear with me then, if lawful what I ask; Love not the heav&amp;#39;nly Spirits, and how thir Love Express they, by looks onely, or do they mix Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch? To whom the Angel with a smile that glow&amp;#39;d Celestial rosie red, Loves proper hue, Answer&amp;#39;d. Let it suffice thee that thou know&amp;#39;st Us happie, and without Love no happiness. Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy&amp;#39;st (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy In eminence, and obstacle find none Of membrane, joynt, or limb, exclusive barrs: Easier then Air with Air; if Spirits embrace, Total they mix, Union of Pure with Pure Desiring; nor restrain&amp;#39;d conveyance need As Flesh to mix with Flesh, or Soul with Soul. But I can now no more; the parting Sun Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles Hesperean sets, my Signal to depart. Be strong, live happie, and love, but first of all Him whom to love is to obey, and keep His great command; take heed least Passion sway Thy judgement to do aught, which else free Will Would not admit; thine and of all thy Sons The weal or woe in thee is plac&amp;#39;t; beware. I in thy persevering shall rejoyce, And all the Blest: stand fast; to stand or fall Free in thine own Arbitrement it lies. Perfet within, no outward aid require; And all temptation to transgress repel. So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus Follow&amp;#39;d with benediction. Since to part, Go heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger, Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore. Gentle to me and affable hath been Thy condescension, and shall be honour&amp;#39;d ever With grateful Memorie: thou to mankind Be good and friendly still, and oft return. So parted they, the Angel up to Heav&amp;#39;n From the thick shade, and Adam to his Bowre.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;NO more of talk where God or Angel Guest With Man, as with his Friend, familiar us&amp;#39;d To sit indulgent, and with him partake Rural repast, permitting him the while Venial discourse unblam&amp;#39;d: I now must change Those Notes to Tragic; foul distrust, and breach Disloyal on the part of Man, revolt, And disobedience: On the part of Heav&amp;#39;n Now alienated, distance and distaste, Anger and just rebuke, and judgement giv&amp;#39;n, That brought into this World a world of woe, Sinne and her shadow Death, and Miserie Deaths Harbinger: Sad task, yet argument Not less but more Heroic then the wrauth Of stern Achilles on his Foe pursu&amp;#39;d Thrice Fugitive about Troy Wall; or rage Of Turnus for Lavinia disespous&amp;#39;d, Or Neptun&amp;#39;s ire or Juno&amp;#39;s, that so long Perplex&amp;#39;d the Greek and Cytherea&amp;#39;s Son; If answerable style I can obtaine Of my Celestial Patroness, who deignes Her nightly visitation unimplor&amp;#39;d, And dictates to me slumbring, or inspires Easie my unpremeditated Verse: Since first this Subject for Heroic Song Pleas&amp;#39;d me long choosing, and beginning late; Not sedulous by Nature to indite Warrs, hitherto the onely Argument Heroic deem&amp;#39;d, chief maistrie to dissect With long and tedious havoc fabl&amp;#39;d Knights In Battels feign&amp;#39;d; the better fortitude Of Patience and Heroic Martyrdom Unsung; or to describe Races and Games, Or tilting Furniture, emblazon&amp;#39;d Shields, Impreses quaint, Caparisons and Steeds; Bases and tinsel Trappings, gorgious Knights At Joust and Torneament; then marshal&amp;#39;d Feast Serv&amp;#39;d up in Hall with Sewers, and Seneshals; The skill of Artifice or Office mean, Not that which justly gives Heroic name To Person or to Poem. Mee of these Nor skilld nor studious, higher Argument Remaines, sufficient of it self to raise That name, unless an age too late, or cold Climat, or Years damp my intended wing Deprest, and much they may, if all be mine, Not Hers who brings it nightly to my Ear. The Sun was sunk, and after him the Starr Of Hesperus, whose Office is to bring Twilight upon the Earth, short Arbiter Twixt Day and Night, and now from end to end Nights Hemisphere had veild the Horizon round: When Satan who late fled before the threats Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improv&amp;#39;d In meditated fraud and malice, bent On mans destruction, maugre what might hap Of heavier on himself, fearless return&amp;#39;d. By Night he fled, and at Midnight return&amp;#39;d From compassing the Earth, cautious of day, Since Uriel Regent of the Sun descri&amp;#39;d His entrance, and forewarnd the Cherubim That kept thir watch; thence full of anguish driv&amp;#39;n, The space of seven continu&amp;#39;d Nights he rode With darkness, thrice the Equinoctial Line He circl&amp;#39;d, four times cross&amp;#39;d the Carr of Night From Pole to Pole, traversing each Colure; On the eighth return&amp;#39;d, and on the Coast averse From entrance or Cherubic Watch, by stealth Found unsuspected way. There was a place, Now not, though Sin, not Time, first wraught the change, Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise Into a Gulf shot under ground, till part Rose up a Fountain by the Tree of Life; In with the River sunk, and with it rose Satan involv&amp;#39;d in rising Mist, then sought Where to lie hid; Sea he had searcht and Land From Eden over Pontus, and the Poole Maotis, up beyond the River Ob; Downward as farr Antartic; and in length West from Orontes to the Ocean barr&amp;#39;d At Darien, thence to the Land where flowes Ganges and Indus: thus the Orb he roam&amp;#39;d With narrow search; and with inspection deep Consider&amp;#39;d every Creature, which of all Most opportune might serve his Wiles, and found The Serpent suttlest Beast of all the Field. Him after long debate, irresolute Of thoughts revolv&amp;#39;d, his final sentence chose Fit Vessel, fittest Imp of fraud, in whom To enter, and his dark suggestions hide From sharpest sight: for in the wilie Snake, Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark, As from his wit and native suttletie Proceeding, which in other Beasts observ&amp;#39;d Doubt might beget of Diabolic pow&amp;#39;r Active within beyond the sense of brute. Thus he resolv&amp;#39;d, but first from inward griefe His bursting passion into plaints thus pour&amp;#39;d: O Earth, how like to Heav&amp;#39;n, if not preferr&amp;#39;d More justly, Seat worthier of Gods, as built With second thoughts, reforming what was old! For what God after better worse would build? Terrestrial Heav&amp;#39;n, danc&amp;#39;t round by other Heav&amp;#39;ns That shine, yet bear thir bright officious Lamps, Light above Light, for thee alone, as seems, In thee concentring all thir precious beams Of sacred influence: As God in Heav&amp;#39;n Is Center, yet extends to all, so thou Centring receav&amp;#39;st from all those Orbs; in thee, Not in themselves, all thir known vertue appeers Productive in Herb, Plant, and nobler birth Of Creatures animate with gradual life Of Growth, Sense, Reason, all summ&amp;#39;d up in Man. With what delight could I have walkt thee round, If I could joy in aught, sweet interchange Of Hill, and Vallie, Rivers, Woods and Plaines, Now Land, now Sea, and Shores with Forrest crownd, Rocks, Dens, and Caves; but I in none of these Find place or refuge; and the more I see Pleasures about me, so much more I feel Torment within me, as from the hateful siege Of contraries; all good to me becomes Bane, and in Heav&amp;#39;n much worse would be my state. But neither here seek I, no nor in Heav&amp;#39;n To dwell, unless by maistring Heav&amp;#39;ns Supreame; Nor hope to be my self less miserable By what I seek, but others to make such As I, though thereby worse to me redound: For onely in destroying I find ease To my relentless thoughts; and him destroyd, Or won to what may work his utter loss, For whom all this was made, all this will soon Follow, as to him linkt in weal or woe, In wo then; that destruction wide may range: To mee shall be the glorie sole among The infernal Powers, in one day to have marr&amp;#39;d What he Almightie styl&amp;#39;d, six Nights and Days Continu&amp;#39;d making, and who knows how long Before had bin contriving, though perhaps Not longer then since I in one Night freed From servitude inglorious welnigh half Th&amp;#39; Angelic Name, and thinner left the throng Of his adorers: hee to be aveng&amp;#39;d, And to repaire his numbers thus impair&amp;#39;d, Whether such vertue spent of old now faild More Angels to Create, if they at least Are his Created, or to spite us more, Determin&amp;#39;d to advance into our room A Creature form&amp;#39;d of Earth, and him endow, Exalted from so base original, With Heav&amp;#39;nly spoils, our spoils: What he decreed He effected; Man he made, and for him built Magnificent this World, and Earth his seat, Him Lord pronounc&amp;#39;d, and, O indignitie! Subjected to his service Angel wings, And flaming Ministers to watch and tend Thir earthy Charge: Of these the vigilance I dread, and to elude, thus wrapt in mist Of midnight vapor glide obscure, and prie In every Bush and Brake, where hap may finde The Serpent sleeping, in whose mazie foulds To hide me, and the dark intent I bring. O foul descent! that I who erst contended With Gods to sit the highest, am now constraind Into a Beast, and mixt with bestial slime, This essence to incarnate and imbrute, That to the hight of Deitie aspir&amp;#39;d; But what will not Ambition and Revenge Descend to? who aspires must down as low As high he soard, obnoxious first or last To basest things. Revenge, at first though sweet, Bitter ere long back on it self recoiles; Let it; I reck not, so it light well aim&amp;#39;d, Since higher I fall short, on him who next Provokes my envie, this new Favorite Of Heav&amp;#39;n, this Man of Clay, Son of despite, Whom us the more to spite his Maker rais&amp;#39;d From dust: spite then with spite is best repaid. So saying, through each Thicket Danck or Drie, Like a black mist low creeping, he held on His midnight search, where soonest he might finde The Serpent: him fast sleeping soon he found In Labyrinth of many a round self-rowld, His head the midst, well stor&amp;#39;d with suttle wiles: Not yet in horrid Shade or dismal Den, Nor nocent yet, but on the grassie Herbe Fearless unfeard he slept: in at his Mouth The Devil enterd, and his brutal sense, In heart or head, possessing soon inspir&amp;#39;d With act intelligential, but his sleep Disturbd not, waiting close th&amp;#39; approach of Morn. Now when as sacred Light began to dawne In Eden on the humid Flours, that breathd Thir morning incense, when all things that breath, From th&amp;#39; Earths great Altar send up silent praise To the Creator, and his Nostrils fill With grateful Smell, forth came the human pair And joind thir vocal Worship to the Quire Of Creatures wanting voice, that done, partake The season, prime for sweetest Sents and Aires: Then commune how that day they best may ply Thir growing work: for much thir work outgrew The hands dispatch of two Gardning so wide. And Eve first to her Husband thus began. Adam, well may we labour still to dress This Garden, still to tend Plant, Herb and Flour, Our pleasant task enjoyn&amp;#39;d, but till more hands Aid us, the work under our labour grows, Luxurious by restraint; what we by day Lop overgrown, or prune, or prop, or bind, One night or two with wanton growth derides Tending to wilde. Thou therefore now advise Or hear what to my minde first thoughts present, Let us divide our labours, thou where choice Leads thee, or where most needs, whether to wind The Woodbine round this Arbour, or direct The clasping Ivie where to climb, while I In yonder Spring of Roses intermixt With Myrtle, find what to redress till Noon: For while so near each other thus all day Our taske we choose, what wonder if so near Looks intervene and smiles, or object new Casual discourse draw on, which intermits Our dayes work brought to little, though begun Early, and th&amp;#39; hour of Supper comes unearn&amp;#39;d. To whom mild answer Adam thus return&amp;#39;d. Sole Eve, Associate sole, to me beyond Compare above all living Creatures deare, Well hast thou motion&amp;#39;d, well thy thoughts imployd How we might best fulfill the work which here God hath assign&amp;#39;d us, nor of me shalt pass Unprais&amp;#39;d: for nothing lovelier can be found In Woman, then to studie houshold good, And good workes in her Husband to promote. Yet not so strictly hath our Lord impos&amp;#39;d Labour, as to debarr us when we need Refreshment, whether food, or talk between, Food of the mind, or this sweet intercourse Of looks and smiles, for smiles from Reason flow, To brute deni&amp;#39;d, and are of Love the food, Love not the lowest end of human life. For not to irksom toile, but to delight He made us, and delight to Reason joyn&amp;#39;d. These paths &amp;amp; Bowers doubt not but our joynt hands Will keep from Wilderness with ease, as wide As we need walk, till younger hands ere long Assist us: But if much converse perhaps Thee satiate, to short absence I could yield. For solitude somtimes is best societie, And short retirement urges sweet returne. But other doubt possesses me, least harm Befall thee sever&amp;#39;d from me; for thou knowst What hath bin warn&amp;#39;d us, what malicious Foe Envying our happiness, and of his own Despairing, seeks to work us woe and shame By sly assault; and somwhere nigh at hand Watches, no doubt, with greedy hope to find His wish and best advantage, us asunder, Hopeless to circumvent us joynd, where each To other speedie aide might lend at need; Whether his first design be to withdraw Our fealtie from God, or to disturb Conjugal Love, then which perhaps no bliss Enjoy&amp;#39;d by us excites his envie more; Or this, or worse, leave not the faithful side That gave thee being, still shades thee and protects. The Wife, where danger or dishonour lurks, Safest and seemliest by her Husband staies, Who guards her, or with her the worst endures. To whom the Virgin Majestie of Eve, As one who loves, and some unkindness meets, With sweet austeer composure thus reply&amp;#39;d, Ofspring of Heav&amp;#39;n and Earth, and all Earths Lord, That such an Enemie we have, who seeks Our ruin, both by thee informd I learne, And from the parting Angel over-heard As in a shadie nook I stood behind, Just then returnd at shut of Evening Flours. But that thou shouldst my firmness therfore doubt To God or thee, because we have a foe May tempt it, I expected not to hear. His violence thou fearst not, being such, As wee, not capable of death or paine, Can either not receave, or can repell. His fraud is then thy fear, which plain inferrs Thy equal fear that my firm Faith and Love Can by his fraud be shak&amp;#39;n or seduc&amp;#39;t; Thoughts, which how found they harbour in thy brest Adam, missthought of her to thee so dear? To whom with healing words Adam replyd. Daughter of God and Man, immortal Eve, For such thou art, from sin and blame entire: Not diffident of thee do I dissuade Thy absence from my sight, but to avoid Th&amp;#39; attempt it self, intended by our Foe. For hee who tempts, though in vain, at least asperses The tempted with dishonour foul, suppos&amp;#39;d Not incorruptible of Faith, not prooff Against temptation: thou thy self with scorne And anger wouldst resent the offer&amp;#39;d wrong, Though ineffectual found: misdeem not then, If such affront I labour to avert From thee alone, which on us both at once The Enemie, though bold, will hardly dare, Or daring, first on mee th&amp;#39; assault shall light. Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn; Suttle he needs must be, who could seduce Angels, nor think superfluous others aid. I from the influence of thy looks receave Access in every Vertue, in thy sight More wise, more watchful, stronger, if need were Of outward strength; while shame, thou looking on, Shame to be overcome or over-reacht Would utmost vigor raise, and rais&amp;#39;d unite. Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel When I am present, and thy trial choose With me, best witness of thy Vertue tri&amp;#39;d. So spake domestick Adam in his care And Matrimonial Love; but Eve, who thought Less attributed to her Faith sincere, Thus her reply with accent sweet renewd. If this be our condition, thus to dwell In narrow circuit strait&amp;#39;nd by a Foe, Suttle or violent, we not endu&amp;#39;d Single with like defence, wherever met, How are we happie, still in fear of harm? But harm precedes not sin: onely our Foe Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem Of our integritie: his foul esteeme Sticks no dishonour on our Front, but turns Foul on himself; then wherefore shund or feard By us? who rather double honour gaine From his surmise prov&amp;#39;d false, find peace within, Favour from Heav&amp;#39;n, our witness from th&amp;#39; event. And what is Faith, Love, Vertue unassaid Alone, without exterior help sustaind? Let us not then suspect our happie State Left so imperfet by the Maker wise, As not secure to single or combin&amp;#39;d. Fraile is our happiness, if this be so, And Eden were no Eden thus expos&amp;#39;d. To whom thus Adam fervently repli&amp;#39;d. O Woman, best are all things as the will Of God ordain&amp;#39;d them, his creating hand Nothing imperfet or deficient left Of all that he Created, much less Man, Or aught that might his happie State secure, Secure from outward force; within himself The danger lies, yet lies within his power: Against his will he can receave no harme. But God left free the Will, for what obeyes Reason, is free, and Reason he made right, But bid her well beware, and still erect, Least by some faire appeering good surpris&amp;#39;d She dictate false, and misinforme the Will To do what God expressly hath forbid. Not then mistrust, but tender love enjoynes, That I should mind thee oft, and mind thou me. Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve, Since Reason not impossibly may meet Some specious object by the Foe subornd, And fall into deception unaware, Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warnd. Seek not temptation then, which to avoide Were better, and most likelie if from mee Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought. Wouldst thou approve thy constancie, approve First thy obedience; th&amp;#39; other who can know, Not seeing thee attempted, who attest? But if thou think, trial unsought may finde Us both securer then thus warnd thou seemst, Go; for thy stay, not free, absents thee more; Go in thy native innocence, relie On what thou hast of vertue, summon all, For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine. So spake the Patriarch of Mankinde, but Eve Persisted, yet submiss, though last, repli&amp;#39;d. With thy permission then, and thus forewarnd Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words Touchd onely, that our trial, when least sought, May finde us both perhaps farr less prepar&amp;#39;d, The willinger I goe, nor much expect A Foe so proud will first the weaker seek; So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse. Thus saying, from her Husbands hand her hand Soft she withdrew, and like a Wood-Nymph light Oread or Dryad, or of Delia&amp;#39;s Traine, Betook her to the Groves, but Delia&amp;#39;s self In gate surpass&amp;#39;d and Goddess-like deport, Though not as shee with Bow and Quiver armd, But with such Gardning Tools as Art yet rude, Guiltless of fire had formd, or Angels brought. To Pales, or Pomona thus adornd, Likeliest she seemd, Pomona when she fled Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her Prime, Yet Virgin of Proserpina from Jove. Her long with ardent look his Eye pursu&amp;#39;d Delighted, but desiring more her stay. Oft he to her his charge of quick returne Repeated, shee to him as oft engag&amp;#39;d To be returnd by Noon amid the Bowre, And all things in best order to invite Noontide repast, or Afternoons repose. O much deceav&amp;#39;d, much failing, hapless Eve, Of thy presum&amp;#39;d return! event perverse! Thou never from that houre in Paradise Foundst either sweet repast, or sound repose; Such ambush hid among sweet Flours and Shades Waited with hellish rancour imminent To intercept thy way, or send thee back Despoild of Innocence, of Faith, of Bliss. For now, and since first break of dawne the Fiend, Meer Serpent in appearance, forth was come, And on his Quest, where likeliest he might finde The onely two of Mankinde, but in them The whole included Race, his purposd prey. In Bowre and Field he sought, where any tuft Of Grove or Garden-Plot more pleasant lay, Thir tendance or Plantation for delight, By Fountain or by shadie Rivulet He sought them both, but wish&amp;#39;d his hap might find Eve separate, he wish&amp;#39;d, but not with hope Of what so seldom chanc&amp;#39;d, when to his wish, Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies, Veild in a Cloud of Fragrance, where she stood, Half spi&amp;#39;d, so thick the Roses bushing round About her glowd, oft stooping to support Each Flour of slender stalk, whose head though gay Carnation, Purple, Azure, or spect with Gold, Hung drooping unsustaind, them she upstaies Gently with Mirtle band, mindless the while, Her self, though fairest unsupported Flour, From her best prop so farr, and storm so nigh. Neerer he drew, and many a walk travers&amp;#39;d Of stateliest Covert, Cedar, Pine, or Palme, Then voluble and bold, now hid, now seen Among thick-wov&amp;#39;n Arborets and Flours Imborderd on each Bank, the hand of Eve: Spot more delicious then those Gardens feign&amp;#39;d Or of reviv&amp;#39;d Adonis, or renownd Alcinous, host of old Laertes Son, Or that, not Mystic, where the Sapient King Held dalliance with his faire Egyptian Spouse. Much hee the Place admir&amp;#39;d, the Person more. As one who long in populous City pent, Where Houses thick and Sewers annoy the Aire, Forth issuing on a Summers Morn to breathe Among the pleasant Villages and Farmes Adjoynd, from each thing met conceaves delight, The smell of Grain, or tedded Grass, or Kine, Or Dairie, each rural sight, each rural sound; If chance with Nymphlike step fair Virgin pass, What pleasing seemd, for her now pleases more, She most, and in her look summs all Delight. Such Pleasure took the Serpent to behold This Flourie Plat, the sweet recess of Eve Thus earlie, thus alone; her Heav&amp;#39;nly forme Angelic, but more soft, and Feminine, Her graceful Innocence, her every Aire Of gesture or lest action overawd His Malice, and with rapine sweet bereav&amp;#39;d His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought: That space the Evil one abstracted stood From his own evil, and for the time remaind Stupidly good, of enmitie disarm&amp;#39;d, Of guile, of hate, of envie, of revenge; But the hot Hell that alwayes in him burnes, Though in mid Heav&amp;#39;n, soon ended his delight, And tortures him now more, the more he sees Of pleasure not for him ordain&amp;#39;d: then soon Fierce hate he recollects, and all his thoughts Of mischief, gratulating, thus excites. Thoughts, whither have ye led me, with what sweet Compulsion thus transported to forget What hither brought us, hate, not love, nor hope Of Paradise for Hell, hope here to taste Of pleasure, but all pleasure to destroy, Save what is in destroying, other joy To me is lost. Then let me not let pass Occasion which now smiles, behold alone The Woman, opportune to all attempts, Her Husband, for I view far round, not nigh, Whose higher intellectual more I shun, And strength, of courage hautie, and of limb Heroic built, though of terrestrial mould, Foe not informidable, exempt from wound, I not; so much hath Hell debas&amp;#39;d, and paine Infeebl&amp;#39;d me, to what I was in Heav&amp;#39;n. Shee fair, divinely fair, fit Love for Gods, Not terrible, though terrour be in Love And beautie, not approacht by stronger hate, Hate stronger, under shew of Love well feign&amp;#39;d, The way which to her ruin now I tend. So spake the Enemie of Mankind, enclos&amp;#39;d In Serpent, Inmate bad, and toward Eve Address&amp;#39;d his way, not with indented wave, Prone on the ground, as since, but on his reare, Circular base of rising foulds, that tour&amp;#39;d Fould above fould a surging Maze, his Head Crested aloft, and Carbuncle his Eyes; With burnisht Neck of verdant Gold, erect Amidst his circling Spires, that on the grass Floted redundant: pleasing was his shape, And lovely, never since of Serpent kind Lovelier, not those that in Illyria chang&amp;#39;d Hermione and Cadmus, or the God In Epidaurus; nor to which transformd Ammonian Jove, or Capitoline was seen, Hee with Olympias, this with her who bore Scipio the highth of Rome. With tract oblique At first, as one who sought access, but feard To interrupt, side-long he works his way. As when a Ship by skilful Stearsman wrought Nigh Rivers mouth or Foreland, where the Wind Veres oft, as oft so steers, and shifts her Saile; So varied hee, and of his tortuous Traine Curld many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve, To lure her Eye; shee busied heard the sound Of rusling Leaves, but minded not, as us&amp;#39;d To such disport before her through the Field, From every Beast, more duteous at her call, Then at Circean call the Herd disguis&amp;#39;d. Hee boulder now, uncall&amp;#39;d before her stood; But as in gaze admiring: Oft he bowd His turret Crest, and sleek enamel&amp;#39;d Neck, Fawning, and lick&amp;#39;d the ground whereon she trod. His gentle dumb expression turnd at length The Eye of Eve to mark his play; he glad Of her attention gaind, with Serpent Tongue Organic, or impulse of vocal Air, His fraudulent temptation thus began. Wonder not, sovran Mistress, if perhaps Thou canst, who art sole Wonder, much less arm Thy looks, the Heav&amp;#39;n of mildness, with disdain, Displeas&amp;#39;d that I approach thee thus, and gaze Insatiate, I thus single, nor have feard Thy awful brow, more awful thus retir&amp;#39;d. Fairest resemblance of thy Maker faire, Thee all things living gaze on, all things thine By gift, and thy Celestial Beautie adore With ravishment beheld, there best beheld Where universally admir&amp;#39;d; but here In this enclosure wild, these Beasts among, Beholders rude, and shallow to discerne Half what in thee is fair, one man except, Who sees thee? (and what is one?) who shouldst be seen A Goddess among Gods, ador&amp;#39;d and serv&amp;#39;d By Angels numberless, thy daily Train. So gloz&amp;#39;d the Tempter, and his Proem tun&amp;#39;d; Into the Heart of Eve his words made way, Though at the voice much marveling; at length Not unamaz&amp;#39;d she thus in answer spake. What may this mean? Language of Man pronounc&amp;#39;t By Tongue of Brute, and human sense exprest? The first at lest of these I thought deni&amp;#39;d To Beasts, whom God on thir Creation-Day Created mute to all articulat sound; The latter I demurre, for in thir looks Much reason, and in thir actions oft appeers. Thee, Serpent, suttlest beast of all the field I knew, but not with human voice endu&amp;#39;d; Redouble then this miracle, and say, How cam&amp;#39;st thou speakable of mute, and how To me so friendly grown above the rest Of brutal kind, that daily are in sight? Say, for such wonder claims attention due. To whom the guileful Tempter thus reply&amp;#39;d. Empress of this fair World, resplendent Eve, Easie to mee it is to tell thee all What thou commandst, and right thou shouldst be obeyd: I was at first as other Beasts that graze The trodden Herb, of abject thoughts and low, As was my food, nor aught but food discern&amp;#39;d Or Sex, and apprehended nothing high: Till on a day roaving the field, I chanc&amp;#39;d A goodly Tree farr distant to behold Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixt, Ruddie and Gold: I nearer drew to gaze; When from the boughes a savorie odour blow&amp;#39;n, Grateful to appetite, more pleas&amp;#39;d my sense Then smell of sweetest Fenel or the Teats Of Ewe or Goat dropping with Milk at Eevn, Unsuckt of Lamb or Kid, that tend thir play. To satisfie the sharp desire I had Of tasting those fair Apples, I resolv&amp;#39;d Not to deferr; hunger and thirst at once, Powerful perswaders, quick&amp;#39;nd at the scent Of that alluring fruit, urg&amp;#39;d me so keene. About the mossie Trunk I wound me soon, For high from ground the branches would require Thy utmost reach or Adams: Round the Tree All other Beasts that saw, with like desire Longing and envying stood, but could not reach. Amid the Tree now got, where plenty hung Tempting so nigh, to pluck and eat my fill I spar&amp;#39;d not, for such pleasure till that hour At Feed or Fountain never had I found. Sated at length, ere long I might perceave Strange alteration in me, to degree Of Reason in my inward Powers, and Speech Wanted not long, though to this shape retain&amp;#39;d. Thenceforth to Speculations high or deep I turnd my thoughts, and with capacious mind Considerd all things visible in Heav&amp;#39;n, Or Earth, or Middle, all things fair and good; But all that fair and good in thy Divine Semblance, and in thy Beauties heav&amp;#39;nly Ray United I beheld; no Fair to thine Equivalent or second, which compel&amp;#39;d Mee thus, though importune perhaps, to come And gaze, and worship thee of right declar&amp;#39;d Sovran of Creatures, universal Dame. So talk&amp;#39;d the spirited sly Snake; and Eve Yet more amaz&amp;#39;d unwarie thus reply&amp;#39;d. Serpent, thy overpraising leaves in doubt The vertue of that Fruit, in thee first prov&amp;#39;d: But say, where grows the Tree, from hence how far? For many are the Trees of God that grow In Paradise, and various, yet unknown To us, in such aboundance lies our choice, As leaves a greater store of Fruit untoucht, Still hanging incorruptible, till men Grow up to thir provision, and more hands Help to disburden Nature of her Bearth. To whom the wilie Adder, blithe and glad. Empress, the way is readie, and not long, Beyond a row of Myrtles, on a Flat, Fast by a Fountain, one small Thicket past Of blowing Myrrh and Balme; if thou accept My conduct, I can bring thee thither soon. Lead then, said Eve. Hee leading swiftly rowld In tangles, and made intricate seem strait, To mischief swift. Hope elevates, and joy Bright&amp;#39;ns his Crest, as when a wandring Fire, Compact of unctuous vapor, which the Night Condenses, and the cold invirons round, Kindl&amp;#39;d through agitation to a Flame, Which oft, they say, some evil Spirit attends Hovering and blazing with delusive Light, Misleads th&amp;#39; amaz&amp;#39;d Night-wanderer from his way To Boggs and Mires, and oft through Pond or Poole, There swallow&amp;#39;d up and lost, from succour farr. So glister&amp;#39;d the dire Snake, and into fraud Led Eve our credulous Mother, to the Tree Of prohibition, root of all our woe; Which when she saw, thus to her guide she spake. Serpent, we might have spar&amp;#39;d our coming hither, Fruitless to mee, though Fruit be here to excess, The credit of whose vertue rest with thee, Wondrous indeed, if cause of such effects. But of this Tree we may not taste nor touch; God so commanded, and left that Command Sole Daughter of his voice; the rest, we live Law to our selves, our Reason is our Law. To whom the Tempter guilefully repli&amp;#39;d. Indeed? hath God then said that of the Fruit Of all these Garden Trees ye shall not eate, Yet Lords declar&amp;#39;d of all in Earth or Aire? To whom thus Eve yet sinless. Of the Fruit Of each Tree in the Garden we may eate, But of the Fruit of this fair Tree amidst The Garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eate Thereof, nor shall ye touch it, least ye die. She scarse had said, though brief, when now more bold The Tempter, but with shew of Zeale and Love To Man, and indignation at his wrong, New part puts on, and as to passion mov&amp;#39;d, Fluctuats disturbd, yet comely and in act Rais&amp;#39;d, as of som great matter to begin. As when of old som Orator renound In Athens or free Rome, where Eloquence Flourishd, since mute, to som great cause addrest, Stood in himself collected, while each part, Motion, each act won audience ere the tongue, Somtimes in highth began, as no delay Of Preface brooking through his Zeal of Right. So standing, moving, or to highth upgrown The Tempter all impassiond thus began. O Sacred, Wise, and Wisdom-giving Plant, Mother of Science, Now I feel thy Power Within me cleere, not onely to discerne Things in thir Causes, but to trace the wayes Of highest Agents, deemd however wise. Queen of this Universe, doe not believe Those rigid threats of Death; ye shall not Die: How should ye? by the Fruit? it gives you Life To Knowledge? By the Threatner, look on mee, Mee who have touch&amp;#39;d and tasted, yet both live, And life more perfet have attaind then Fate Meant mee, by ventring higher then my Lot. Shall that be shut to Man, which to the Beast Is open? or will God incense his ire For such a petty Trespass, and not praise Rather your dauntless vertue, whom the pain Of Death denounc&amp;#39;t, whatever thing Death be, Deterrd not from atchieving what might leade To happier life, knowledge of Good and Evil; Of good, how just? of evil, if what is evil Be real, why not known, since easier shunnd? God therefore cannot hurt ye, and be just; Not just, not God; not feard then, nor obeyd: Your feare it self of Death removes the feare. Why then was this forbid? Why but to awe, Why but to keep ye low and ignorant, His worshippers; he knows that in the day Ye Eate thereof, your Eyes that seem so cleere, Yet are but dim, shall perfetly be then Op&amp;#39;nd and cleerd, and ye shall be as Gods, Knowing both Good and Evil as they know. That ye should be as Gods, since I as Man, Internal Man, is but proportion meet, I of brute human, yee of human Gods. So ye shall die perhaps, by putting off Human, to put on Gods, death to be wisht, Though threat&amp;#39;nd, which no worse then this can bring. And what are Gods that Man may not become As they, participating God-like food? The Gods are first, and that advantage use On our belief, that all from them proceeds; I question it, for this fair Earth I see, Warm&amp;#39;d by the Sun, producing every kind, Them nothing: If they all things, who enclos&amp;#39;d Knowledge of Good and Evil in this Tree, That whoso eats thereof, forthwith attains Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies Th&amp;#39; offence, that Man should thus attain to know? What can your knowledge hurt him, or this Tree Impart against his will if all be his? Or is it envie, and can envie dwell In heav&amp;#39;nly breasts? these, these and many more Causes import your need of this fair Fruit. Goddess humane, reach then, and freely taste. He ended, and his words replete with guile Into her heart too easie entrance won: Fixt on the Fruit she gaz&amp;#39;d, which to behold Might tempt alone, and in her ears the sound Yet rung of his perswasive words, impregn&amp;#39;d With Reason, to her seeming, and with Truth; Mean while the hour of Noon drew on, and wak&amp;#39;d An eager appetite, rais&amp;#39;d by the smell So savorie of that Fruit, which with desire, Inclinable now grown to touch or taste, Sollicited her longing eye; yet first Pausing a while, thus to her self she mus&amp;#39;d. Great are thy Vertues, doubtless, best of Fruits, Though kept from Man, and worthy to be admir&amp;#39;d, Whose taste, too long forborn, at first assay Gave elocution to the mute, and taught The Tongue not made for Speech to speak thy praise: Thy praise hee also who forbids thy use, Conceales not from us, naming thee the Tree Of Knowledge, knowledge both of good and evil; Forbids us then to taste, but his forbidding Commends thee more, while it inferrs the good By thee communicated, and our want: For good unknown, sure is not had, or had And yet unknown, is as not had at all. In plain then, what forbids he but to know, Forbids us good, forbids us to be wise? Such prohibitions binde not. But if Death Bind us with after-bands, what profits then Our inward freedom? In the day we eate Of this fair Fruit, our doom is, we shall die. How dies the Serpent? hee hath eat&amp;#39;n and lives, And knows, and speaks, and reasons, and discerns, Irrational till then. For us alone Was death invented? or to us deni&amp;#39;d This intellectual food, for beasts reserv&amp;#39;d? For Beasts it seems: yet that one Beast which first Hath tasted, envies not, but brings with joy The good befall&amp;#39;n him, Author unsuspect, Friendly to man, farr from deceit or guile. What fear I then, rather what know to feare Under this ignorance of good and Evil, Of God or Death, of Law or Penaltie? Here grows the Cure of all, this Fruit Divine, Fair to the Eye, inviting to the Taste, Of vertue to make wise: what hinders then To reach, and feed at once both Bodie and Mind? So saying, her rash hand in evil hour Forth reaching to the Fruit, she pluck&amp;#39;d, she eat: Earth felt the wound, and Nature from her seat Sighing through all her Works gave signs of woe, That all was lost. Back to the Thicket slunk The guiltie Serpent, and well might, for Eve Intent now wholly on her taste, naught else Regarded, such delight till then, as seemd, In Fruit she never tasted, whether true Or fansied so, through expectation high Of knowledg, nor was God-head from her thought. Greedily she ingorg&amp;#39;d without restraint, And knew not eating Death: Satiate at length, And hight&amp;#39;nd as with Wine, jocond and boon, Thus to her self she pleasingly began. O Sovran, vertuous, precious of all Trees In Paradise, of operation blest To Sapience, hitherto obscur&amp;#39;d, infam&amp;#39;d, And thy fair Fruit let hang, as to no end Created; but henceforth my early care, Not without Song, each Morning, and due praise Shall tend thee, and the fertil burden ease Of thy full branches offer&amp;#39;d free to all; Till dieted by thee I grow mature In knowledge, as the Gods who all things know; Though others envie what they cannot give; For had the gift bin theirs, it had not here Thus grown. Experience, next to thee I owe, Best guide; not following thee, I had remaind In ignorance, thou op&amp;#39;nst Wisdoms way, And giv&amp;#39;st access, though secret she retire. And I perhaps am secret; Heav&amp;#39;n is high, High and remote to see from thence distinct Each thing on Earth; and other care perhaps May have diverted from continual watch Our great Forbidder, safe with all his Spies About him. But to Adam in what sort Shall I appeer? shall I to him make known As yet my change, and give him to partake Full happiness with mee, or rather not, But keep the odds of Knowledge in my power Without Copartner? so to add what wants In Femal Sex, the more to draw his Love, And render me more equal, and perhaps, A thing not undesireable, somtime Superior; for inferior who is free? This may be well: but what if God have seen, And Death ensue? then I shall be no more, And Adam wedded to another Eve, Shall live with her enjoying, I extinct; A death to think. Confirm&amp;#39;d then I resolve; Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe: So dear I love him, that with him all deaths I could endure, without him live no life. So saying, from the Tree her step she turnd, But first low Reverence don, as to the power That dwelt within, whose presence had infus&amp;#39;d Into the plant sciential sap, deriv&amp;#39;d From Nectar, drink of Gods. Adam the while Waiting desirous her return, had wove Of choicest Flours a Garland to adorne Her Tresses, and her rural labours crown, As Reapers oft are wont thir Harvest Queen. Great joy he promis&amp;#39;d to his thoughts, and new Solace in her return, so long delay&amp;#39;d; Yet oft his heart, divine of somthing ill, Misgave him; hee the faultring measure felt; And forth to meet her went, the way she took That Morn when first they parted; by the Tree Of Knowledge he must pass, there he her met, Scarse from the Tree returning; in her hand A bough of fairest fruit that downie smil&amp;#39;d, New gatherd, and ambrosial smell diffus&amp;#39;d. To him she hasted, in her face excuse Came Prologue, and Apologie to prompt, Which with bland words at will she thus addrest. Hast thou not wonderd, Adam, at my stay? Thee I have misst, and thought it long, depriv&amp;#39;d Thy presence, agonie of love till now Not felt, nor shall be twice, for never more Mean I to trie, what rash untri&amp;#39;d I sought, The pain of absence from thy sight. But strange Hath bin the cause, and wonderful to heare: This Tree is not as we are told, a Tree Of danger tasted, nor to evil unknown Op&amp;#39;ning the way, but of Divine effect To open Eyes, and make them Gods who taste; And hath bin tasted such: the Serpent wise, Or not restraind as wee, or not obeying, Hath eat&amp;#39;n of the fruit, and is become, Not dead, as we are threatn&amp;#39;d, but thenceforth Endu&amp;#39;d with human voice and human sense, Reasoning to admiration, and with mee Perswasively hath so prevaild, that I Have also tasted, and have also found Th&amp;#39; effects to correspond, opener mine Eyes, Dimm erst, dilated Spirits, ampler Heart, And growing up to Godhead; which for thee Chiefly I sought, without thee can despise. For bliss, as thou hast part, to me is bliss, Tedious, unshar&amp;#39;d with thee, and odious soon. Thou therefore also taste, that equal Lot May joyne us, equal joy, as equal Love; Least thou not tasting, different degree Disjoyne us, and I then too late renounce Deitie for thee, when Fate will not permit. Thus Eve with Countnance blithe her storie told; But in her Cheek distemper flushing glowd. On th&amp;#39; other side, Adam, soon as he heard The fatal Trespass don by Eve, amaz&amp;#39;d, Astonied stood and Blank, while horror chill Ran through his veins, and all his joynts relax&amp;#39;d; From his slack hand the Garland wreath&amp;#39;d for Eve Down drop&amp;#39;d, and all the faded Roses shed: Speechless he stood and pale, till thus at length First to himself he inward silence broke. O fairest of Creation, last and best Of all Gods works, Creature in whom excell&amp;#39;d Whatever can to sight or thought be formd, Holy, divine, good, amiable, or sweet! How art thou lost, how on a sudden lost, Defac&amp;#39;t, deflourd, and now to Death devote? Rather how hast thou yeelded to transgress The strict forbiddance, how to violate The sacred Fruit forbidd&amp;#39;n! som cursed fraud Of Enemie hath beguil&amp;#39;d thee, yet unknown, And mee with thee hath ruind, for with thee Certain my resolution is to Die; How can I live without thee, how forgoe Thy sweet Converse and Love so dearly joyn&amp;#39;d, To live again in these wilde Woods forlorn? Should God create another Eve, and I Another Rib afford, yet loss of thee Would never from my heart; no no, I feel The Link of Nature draw me: Flesh of Flesh, Bone of my Bone thou art, and from thy State Mine never shall be parted, bliss or woe. So having said, as one from sad dismay Recomforted, and after thoughts disturbd Submitting to what seemd remediless, Thus in calm mood his Words to Eve he turnd. Bold deed thou hast presum&amp;#39;d, adventrous Eve, And peril great provok&amp;#39;t, who thus hath dar&amp;#39;d Had it been onely coveting to Eye That sacred Fruit, sacred to abstinence, Much more to taste it under banne to touch. But past who can recall, or don undoe? Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate, yet so Perhaps thou shalt not Die, perhaps the Fact Is not so hainous now, foretasted Fruit, Profan&amp;#39;d first by the Serpent, by him first Made common and unhallowd ere our taste; Nor yet on him found deadly, he yet lives, Lives, as thou saidst, and gaines to live as Man Higher degree of Life, inducement strong To us, as likely tasting to attaine Proportional ascent, which cannot be But to be Gods, or Angels Demi-gods. Nor can I think that God, Creator wise, Though threatning, will in earnest so destroy Us his prime Creatures, dignifi&amp;#39;d so high, Set over all his Works, which in our Fall, For us created, needs with us must faile, Dependent made; so God shall uncreate, Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour loose, Not well conceav&amp;#39;d of God, who though his Power Creation could repeate, yet would be loath Us to abolish, least the Adversary Triumph and say; Fickle their State whom God Most Favors, who can please him long; Mee first He ruind, now Mankind; whom will he next? Matter of scorne, not to be given the Foe, However I with thee have fixt my Lot, Certain to undergoe like doom, if Death Consort with thee, Death is to mee as Life; So forcible within my heart I feel The Bond of Nature draw me to my owne, My own in thee, for what thou art is mine; Our State cannot be severd, we are one, One Flesh; to loose thee were to loose my self. So Adam, and thus Eve to him repli&amp;#39;d. O glorious trial of exceeding Love, Illustrious evidence, example high! Ingaging me to emulate, but short Of thy perfection, how shall I attaine, Adam, from whose deare side I boast me sprung, And gladly of our Union heare thee speak, One Heart, one Soul in both; whereof good prooff This day affords, declaring thee resolvd, Rather then Death or aught then Death more dread Shall separate us, linkt in Love so deare, To undergoe with mee one Guilt, one Crime, If any be, of tasting this fair Fruit, Whose vertue, for of good still good proceeds, Direct, or by occasion hath presented This happie trial of thy Love, which else So eminently never had bin known. Were it I thought Death menac&amp;#39;t would ensue This my attempt, I would sustain alone The worst, and not perswade thee, rather die Deserted, then oblige thee with a fact Pernicious to thy Peace, chiefly assur&amp;#39;d Remarkably so late of thy so true, So faithful Love unequald; but I feel Farr otherwise th&amp;#39; event, not Death, but Life Augmented, op&amp;#39;nd Eyes, new Hopes, new Joyes, Taste so Divine, that what of sweet before Hath toucht my sense, flat seems to this, and harsh. On my experience, Adam, freely taste, And fear of Death deliver to the Windes. So saying, she embrac&amp;#39;d him, and for joy Tenderly wept, much won that he his Love Had so enobl&amp;#39;d, as of choice to incurr Divine displeasure for her sake, or Death. In recompence (for such compliance bad Such recompence best merits) from the bough She gave him of that fair enticing Fruit With liberal hand: he scrupl&amp;#39;d not to eat Against his better knowledge, not deceav&amp;#39;d, But fondly overcome with Femal charm. Earth trembl&amp;#39;d from her entrails, as again In pangs, and Nature gave a second groan, Skie lowr&amp;#39;d and muttering Thunder, som sad drops Wept at compleating of the mortal Sin Original; while Adam took no thought, Eating his fill, nor Eve to iterate Her former trespass fear&amp;#39;d, the more to soothe Him with her lov&amp;#39;d societie, that now As with new Wine intoxicated both They swim in mirth, and fansie that they feel Divinitie within them breeding wings Wherewith to scorne the Earth: but that false Fruit Farr other operation first displaid, Carnal desire enflaming, hee on Eve Began to cast lascivious Eyes, she him As wantonly repaid; in Lust they burne: Till Adam thus&amp;#39;gan Eve to dalliance move, Eve, now I see thou art exact of taste, And elegant, of Sapience no small part, Since to each meaning savour we apply, And Palate call judicious; I the praise Yeild thee, so well this day thou hast purvey&amp;#39;d. Much pleasure we have lost, while we abstain&amp;#39;d From this delightful Fruit, nor known till now True relish, tasting; if such pleasure be In things to us forbidden, it might be wish&amp;#39;d, For this one Tree had bin forbidden ten. But come, so well refresh&amp;#39;t, now let us play, As meet is, after such delicious Fare; For never did thy Beautie since the day I saw thee first and wedded thee, adorn&amp;#39;d With all perfections, so enflame my sense With ardor to enjoy thee, fairer now Then ever, bountie of this vertuous Tree. So said he, and forbore not glance or toy Of amorous intent, well understood Of Eve, whose Eye darted contagious Fire. Her hand he seis&amp;#39;d, and to a shadie bank, Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowr&amp;#39;d He led her nothing loath; Flours were the Couch, Pansies, and Violets, and Asphodel, And Hyacinth, Earths freshest softest lap. There they thir fill of Love and Loves disport Took largely, of thir mutual guilt the Seale, The solace of thir sin, till dewie sleep Oppress&amp;#39;d them, wearied with thir amorous play. Soon as the force of that fallacious Fruit, That with exhilerating vapour bland About thir spirits had plaid, and inmost powers Made erre, was now exhal&amp;#39;d, and grosser sleep Bred of unkindly fumes, with conscious dreams Encumberd, now had left them, up they rose As from unrest, and each the other viewing, Soon found thir Eyes how op&amp;#39;nd, and thir minds How dark&amp;#39;nd; innocence, that as a veile Had shadow&amp;#39;d them from knowing ill, was gon, Just confidence, and native righteousness And honour from about them, naked left To guiltie shame hee cover&amp;#39;d, but his Robe Uncover&amp;#39;d more, so rose the Danite strong Herculean Samson from the Harlot-lap Of Philistean Dalilah, and wak&amp;#39;d Shorn of his strength, They destitute and bare Of all thir vertue: silent, and in face Confounded long they sate, as struck&amp;#39;n mute, Till Adam, though not less then Eve abash&amp;#39;t, At length gave utterance to these words constraind. Eve, in evil hour thou didst give eare To that false Worm, of whomsoever taught To counterfet Mans voice, true in our Fall, False in our promis&amp;#39;d Rising; since our Eyes Op&amp;#39;nd we find indeed, and find we know Both Good and Evil, Good lost, and Evil got, Bad Fruit of Knowledge, if this be to know, Which leaves us naked thus, of Honour void, Of Innocence, of Faith, of Puritie, Our wonted Ornaments now soild and staind, And in our Faces evident the signes Of foul concupiscence; whence evil store; Even shame, the last of evils; of the first Be sure then. How shall I behold the face Henceforth of God or Angel, earst with joy And rapture so oft beheld? those heav&amp;#39;nly shapes Will dazle now this earthly, with thir blaze Insufferably bright. O might I here In solitude live savage, in some glade Obscur&amp;#39;d, where highest Woods impenetrable To Starr or Sun-light, spread thir umbrage broad And brown as Evening: Cover me ye Pines, Ye Cedars, with innumerable boughs Hide me, where I may never see them more. But let us now, as in bad plight, devise What best may from the present serve to hide The Parts of each for other, that seem most To shame obnoxious, and unseemliest seen, Some Tree whose broad smooth Leaves together sowd, And girded on our loyns, may cover round Those middle parts, that this new commer, Shame, There sit not, and reproach us as unclean. So counsel&amp;#39;d hee, and both together went Into the thickest Wood, there soon they chose The Figtree, not that kind for Fruit renown&amp;#39;d, But such as at this day to Indians known In Malabar or Decan spreds her Armes Braunching so broad and long, that in the ground The bended Twigs take root, and Daughters grow About the Mother Tree, a Pillard shade High overarch&amp;#39;t, and echoing Walks between; There oft the Indian Herdsman shunning heate Shelters in coole, and tends his pasturing Herds At Loopholes cut through thickest shade: Those Leaves They gatherd, broad as Amazonian Targe, And with what skill they had, together sowd, To gird thir waste, vain Covering if to hide Thir guilt and dreaded shame; O how unlike To that first naked Glorie. Such of late Columbus found th&amp;#39; American so girt With featherd Cincture, naked else and wilde Among the Trees on Iles and woodie Shores. Thus fenc&amp;#39;t, and as they thought, thir shame in part Coverd, but not at rest or ease of Mind, They sate them down to weep, nor onely Teares Raind at thir Eyes, but high Winds worse within Began to rise, high Passions, Anger, Hate, Mistrust, Suspicion, Discord, and shook sore Thir inward State of Mind, calm Region once And full of Peace, now tost and turbulent: For Understanding rul&amp;#39;d not, and the Will Heard not her lore, both in subjection now To sensual Appetite, who from beneathe Usurping over sovran Reason claimd Superior sway: from thus distemperd brest, Adam, estrang&amp;#39;d in look and alterd stile, Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewd. Would thou hadst heark&amp;#39;nd to my words, and stai&amp;#39;d With me, as I besought thee, when that strange Desire of wandring this unhappie Morn, I know not whence possessd thee; we had then Remaind still happie, not as now, despoild Of all our good, sham&amp;#39;d, naked, miserable. Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve The Faith they owe; when earnestly they seek Such proof, conclude, they then begin to faile. To whom soon mov&amp;#39;d with touch of blame thus Eve. What words have past thy Lips, Adam severe, Imput&amp;#39;st thou that to my default, or will Of wandring, as thou call&amp;#39;st it, which who knows But might as ill have happ&amp;#39;nd thou being by, Or to thy self perhaps: hadst thou been there, Or here th&amp;#39; attempt, thou couldst not have discernd Fraud in the Serpent, speaking as he spake; No ground of enmitie between us known, Why hee should mean me ill, or seek to harme, Was I to have never parted from thy side? As good have grown there still a liveless Rib. Being as I am, why didst not thou the Head Command me absolutely not to go, Going into such danger as thou saidst? Too facil then thou didst not much gainsay, Nay didst permit, approve, and fair dismiss. Hadst thou bin firm and fixt in thy dissent, Neither had I transgress&amp;#39;d, nor thou with mee. To whom then first incenst Adam repli&amp;#39;d, Is this the Love, is this the recompence Of mine to thee, ingrateful Eve, exprest Immutable when thou wert lost, not I, Who might have liv&amp;#39;d and joyd immortal bliss, Yet willingly chose rather Death with thee: And am I now upbraided, as the cause Of thy transgressing? not enough severe, It seems, in thy restraint: what could I more? I warn&amp;#39;d thee, I admonish&amp;#39;d thee, foretold The danger, and the lurking Enemie That lay in wait; beyond this had bin force, And force upon free will hath here no place. But confidence then bore thee on, secure Either to meet no danger, or to finde Matter of glorious trial; and perhaps I also err&amp;#39;d in overmuch admiring What seemd in thee so perfet, that I thought No evil durst attempt thee, but I rue That errour now, which is become my crime, And thou th&amp;#39; accuser. Thus it shall befall Him who to worth in Women overtrusting Lets her will rule; restraint she will not brook, And left to her self, if evil thence ensue, Shee first his weak indulgence will accuse. Thus they in mutual accusation spent The fruitless hours, but neither self-condemning, And of thir vain contest appeer&amp;#39;d no end.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I Who e&amp;#39;re while the happy Garden sung, By one mans disobedience lost, now sing Recover&amp;#39;d Paradise to all mankind, By one mans firm obedience fully tri&amp;#39;d Through all temptation, and the Tempter foil&amp;#39;d In all his wiles, defeated and repuls&amp;#39;t, And Eden rais&amp;#39;d in the wast Wilderness. Thou Spirit who ledst this glorious Eremite Into the Desert, his Victorious Field Against the Spiritual Foe, and broughtst him thence By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire, As thou art wont, my prompted Song else mute, And bear through highth or depth of natures bounds With prosperous wing full summ&amp;#39;d to tell of deeds Above Heroic, though in secret done, And unrecorded left through many an Age, Worthy t&amp;#39;have not remain&amp;#39;d so long unsung. Now had the great Proclaimer with a voice More awful then the sound of Trumpet, cri&amp;#39;d Repentance, and Heavens Kingdom nigh at hand To all Baptiz&amp;#39;d: to his great Baptism flock&amp;#39;d With aw the Regions round, and with them came From Nazareth the Son of Joseph deem&amp;#39;d To the flood Jordan, came as then obscure, Unmarkt, unknown; but him the Baptist soon Descri&amp;#39;d, divinely warn&amp;#39;d, and witness bore As to his worthier, and would have resign&amp;#39;d To him his Heavenly Office, nor was long His witness unconfirm&amp;#39;d: on him baptiz&amp;#39;d Heaven open&amp;#39;d, and in likeness of a Dove The Spirit descended, while the Fathers voice From Heav&amp;#39;n pronounc&amp;#39;d him his beloved Son. That heard the Adversary, who roving still About the world, at that assembly fam&amp;#39;d Would not be last, and with the voice divine Nigh Thunder-struck, th&amp;#39; exalted man, to whom Such high attest was giv&amp;#39;n, a while survey&amp;#39;d With wonder, then with envy fraught and rage Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air To Councel summons all his mighty Peers, Within thick Clouds and dark ten-fold involv&amp;#39;d, A gloomy Consistory; and them amidst With looks agast and sad he thus bespake. O ancient Powers of Air and this wide world, For much more willingly I mention Air, This our old Conquest, then remember Hell Our hated habitation; well ye know How many Ages, as the years of men, This Universe we have possest, and rul&amp;#39;d In manner at our will th&amp;#39; affairs of Earth, Since Adam and his facil consort Eve Lost Paradise deceiv&amp;#39;d by me, though since With dread attending when that fatal wound Shall be inflicted by the Seed of Eve Upon my head, long the decrees of Heav&amp;#39;n Delay, for longest time to him is short; And now too soon for us the circling hours This dreaded time have compast, wherein we Must bide the stroak of that long threatn&amp;#39;d wound, At least if so we can, and by the head Broken be not intended all our power To be infring&amp;#39;d, our freedom and our being. In this fair Empire won of Earth and Air; For this ill news I bring, the Womans seed Destin&amp;#39;d to this, is late of woman born, His birth to our just fear gave no small cause, But his growth now to youths full flowr, displaying All vertue, grace and wisdom to atchieve Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear. Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim His coming, is sent Harbinger, who all Invites, and in the Consecrated stream Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so Purified to receive him pure, or rather To do him honour as their King; all come, And he himself among them was baptiz&amp;#39;d, Not thence to be more pure, but to receive The testimony of Heaven, that who he is Thenceforth the Nations may not doubt; I saw The Prophet do him reverence, on him rising Out of the water, Heav&amp;#39;n above the Clouds Unfold her Crystal Dores, thence on his head A perfect Dove descend, what e&amp;#39;re it meant, And out of Heav&amp;#39;n the Sov&amp;#39;raign voice I heard, This is my Son belov&amp;#39;d, in him am pleas&amp;#39;d. His Mother then is mortal, but his Sire, He who obtains the Monarchy of Heav&amp;#39;n, And what will he not do to advance his Son? His first-begot we know, and sore have felt, When his fierce thunder drove us to the deep; Who this is we must learn, for man he seems In all his lineaments, though in his face The glimpses of his Fathers glory shine. Ye see our danger on the utmost edge Of hazard, which admits no long debate, But must with something sudden be oppos&amp;#39;d, Not force, but well couch&amp;#39;t fraud, well woven snares, E&amp;#39;re in the head of Nations he appear Their King, their Leader, and Supream on Earth. I, when no other durst, sole undertook The dismal expedition to find out And ruine Adam, and the exploit perform&amp;#39;d Successfully; a calmer voyage now Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once Induces best to hope of like success. He ended, and his words impression left Of much amazement to th&amp;#39; infernal Crew, Distracted and surpriz&amp;#39;d with deep dismay At these sad tidings; but no time was then For long indulgence to their fears or grief: Unanimous they all commit the care And management of this main enterprize To him their great Dictator, whose attempt At first against mankind so well had thriv&amp;#39;d In Adam&amp;#39;s overthrow, and led thir march From Hell&amp;#39;s deep-vaulted Den to dwell in light, Regents and Potentates, and Kings, yea gods Of many a pleasant Realm and Province wide. So to the Coast of Jordan he directs His easie steps; girded with snaky wiles, Where he might likeliest find this new-declar&amp;#39;d, This man of men, attested Son of God, Temptation and all guile on him to try; So to subvert whom he suspected rais&amp;#39;d To end his Raign on Earth so long enjoy&amp;#39;d: But contrary unweeting he fulfill&amp;#39;d The purpos&amp;#39;d Counsel pre-ordain&amp;#39;d and fixt Of the most High, who in full frequence bright Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake. Gabriel this day by proof thou shalt behold, Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth With man or mens affairs, how I begin To verifie that solemn message late, On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure In Galilee, that she should bear a Son Great in Renown, and call&amp;#39;d the Son of God; Then toldst her doubting how these things could be To her a Virgin, that on her should come The Holy Ghost, and the power of the highest O&amp;#39;re-shadow her: this man born and now up-grown, To shew him worthy of his birth divine And high prediction, henceforth I expose To Satan; let him tempt and now assay His utmost subtilty, because he boasts And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng Of his Apostasie; he might have learnt Less over-weening, since he fail&amp;#39;d in Job, Whose constant perseverance overcame Whate&amp;#39;re his cruel malice could invent. He now shall know I can produce a man Of female Seed, far abler to resist All his sollicitations, and at length All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell, Winning by Conquest what the first man lost By fallacy surpriz&amp;#39;d. But first I mean To exercise him in the Wilderness, There he shall first lay down the rudiments Of his great warfare, e&amp;#39;re I send him forth To conquer Sin and Death the two grand foes, By Humiliation and strong Sufferance: His weakness shall o&amp;#39;recome Satanic strength And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh; That all the Angels and Ætherial Powers, They now, and men hereafter may discern, From what consummate vertue I have chose This perfect Man, by merit call&amp;#39;d my Son, To earn Salvation for the Sons of men. So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven Admiring stood a space, then into Hymns Burst forth, and in Celestial measures mov&amp;#39;d, Circling the Throne and Singing, while the hand Sung with the voice, and this the argument. Victory and Triumph to the Son of God Now entring his great duel, not of arms, But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles. The Father knows the Son; therefore secure Ventures his filial Vertue, though untri&amp;#39;d, Against whate&amp;#39;re may tempt, whate&amp;#39;re seduce, Allure, or terrifie, or undermine. Be frustrate all ye stratagems of Hell, And devilish machinations come to nought. So they in Heav&amp;#39;n their Odes and Vigils tun&amp;#39;d: Mean while the Son of God, who yet some days Lodg&amp;#39;d in Bethabara where John baptiz&amp;#39;d, Musing and much revolving in his brest, How best the mighty work he might begin Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first Publish his God-like office now mature, One day forth walk&amp;#39;d alone, the Spirit leading; And his deep thoughts, the better to converse With solitude, till far from track of men, Thought following thought, and step by step led on, He entred now the bordering Desert wild, And with dark shades and rocks environ&amp;#39;d round, His holy Meditations thus persu&amp;#39;d. O what a multitude of thoughts at once Awakn&amp;#39;d in me swarm, while I consider What from within I feel my self, and hear What from without comes often to my ears, Ill sorting with my present state compar&amp;#39;d. When I was yet a child, no childish play To me was pleasing, all my mind was set Serious to learn and know, and thence to do What might be publick good; my self I thought Born to that end, born to promote all truth, All righteous things: therefore above my years, The Law of God I read, and found it sweet, Made it my whole delight, and in it grew To such perfection, that e&amp;#39;re yet my age Had measur&amp;#39;d twice six years, at our great Feast I went into the Temple, there to hear The Teachers of our Law, and to propose What might improve my knowledge or their own; And was admir&amp;#39;d by all, yet this not all To which my Spirit aspir&amp;#39;d, victorious deeds Flam&amp;#39;d in my heart, heroic acts, one while To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke, Then to subdue and quell o&amp;#39;re all the earth Brute violence and proud Tyrannick pow&amp;#39;r, Till truth were freed, and equity restor&amp;#39;d: Yet held it more humane, more heavenly first By winning words to conquer willing hearts, And make perswasion do the work of fear; At least to try, and teach the erring Soul Not wilfully mis-doing, but unware Misled; the stubborn only to destroy. These growing thoughts my Mother soon perceiving By words at times cast forth inly rejoyc&amp;#39;d, And said to me apart, high are thy thoughts O Son, but nourish them and let them soar To what highth sacred vertue and true worth Can raise them, though above example high; By matchless Deeds express thy matchless Sire. For know, thou art no Son of mortal man, Though men esteem thee low of Parentage, Thy Father is the Eternal King, who rules All Heaven and Earth, Angels and Sons of men, A messenger from God fore-told thy birth Conceiv&amp;#39;d in me a Virgin, he fore-told Thou shouldst be great and sit on David&amp;#39;s Throne, And of thy Kingdom there should be no end. At thy Nativity a glorious Quire Of Angels in the fields of Bethlehem sung To Shepherds watching at their folds by night, And told them the Messiah now was born, Where they might see him, and to thee they came; Directed to the Manger where thou lais&amp;#39;t, For in the Inn was left no better room: A Star, not seen before in Heaven appearing Guided the Wise Men thither from the East, To honour thee with Incense, Myrrh, and Gold, By whose bright course led on they found the place, Affirming it thy Star new grav&amp;#39;n in Heaven, By which they knew thee King of Israel born. Just Simeon and Prophetic Anna, warn&amp;#39;d By Vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake Before the Altar and the vested Priest, Like things of thee to all that present stood. This having heard, strait I again revolv&amp;#39;d The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ Concerning the Messiah, to our Scribes Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake I am; this chiefly, that my way must lie Through many a hard assay even to the death, E&amp;#39;re I the promis&amp;#39;d Kingdom can attain, Or work Redemption for mankind, whose sins Full weight must be transferr&amp;#39;d upon my head. Yet neither thus disheartn&amp;#39;d or dismay&amp;#39;d, The time prefixt I waited, when behold The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard, Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come Before Messiah and his way prepare. I as all others to his Baptism came, Which I believ&amp;#39;d was from above; but he Strait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim&amp;#39;d Me him (for it was shew&amp;#39;n him so from Heaven) Me him whose Harbinger he was; and first Refus&amp;#39;d on me his Baptism to confer, As much his greater, and was hardly won; But as I rose out of the laving stream, Heaven open&amp;#39;d her eternal doors, from whence The Spirit descended on me like a Dove, And last the sum of all, my Father&amp;#39;s voice, Audibly heard from Heav&amp;#39;n, pronounc&amp;#39;d me his, Me his beloved Son, in whom alone He was well pleas&amp;#39;d; by which I knew the time Now full, that I no more should live obscure, But openly begin, as best becomes The Authority which I deriv&amp;#39;d from Heaven. And now by some strong motion I am led Into this Wilderness, to what intent I learn not yet, perhaps I need not know; For what concerns my knowledge God reveals. So spake our Morning Star then in his rise, And looking round on every side beheld A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades; The way he came not having mark&amp;#39;d, return Was difficult, by humane steps untrod; And he still on was led, but with such thoughts Accompanied of things past and to come Lodg&amp;#39;d in his breast, as well might recommend Such Solitude before choicest Society. Full forty days he pass&amp;#39;d, whether on hill Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night Under the covert of some ancient Oak, Or Cedar, to defend him from the dew, Or harbour&amp;#39;d in one Cave, is not reveal&amp;#39;d; Nor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt Till those days ended, hunger&amp;#39;d then at last Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild, Nor sleeping him nor waking harm&amp;#39;d, his walk The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm, The Lion and fierce Tiger glar&amp;#39;d aloof. But now an aged man in Rural weeds, Following, as seem&amp;#39;d, the quest of some stray Ewe, Or wither&amp;#39;d sticks to gather; which might serve Against a Winters day when winds blow keen, To warm him wet return&amp;#39;d from field at Eve, He saw approach, who first with curious eye Perus&amp;#39;d him, then with words thus utt&amp;#39;red spake. Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place So far from path or road of men, who pass In Troop or Caravan, for single none Durst ever, who return&amp;#39;d, and dropt not here His Carcass, pin&amp;#39;d with hunger and with droughth? I ask the rather, and the more admire, For that to me thou seem&amp;#39;st the man, whom late Our new baptizing Prophet at the Ford Of Jordan honour&amp;#39;d so, and call&amp;#39;d thee Son Of God; I saw and heard, for we sometimes Who dwell this wild, constrain&amp;#39;d by want, come forth To Town or Village nigh (nighest is far) Where ought we hear, and curious are to hear, What happ&amp;#39;ns new; Fame also finds us out. To whom the Son of God. Who brought me hither Will bring me hence, no other Guide I seek. By Miracle he may, reply&amp;#39;d the Swain, What other way I see not, for we here Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur&amp;#39;d More then the Camel, and to drink go far, Men to much misery and hardship born; But if thou be the Son of God, Command That out of these hard stones be made thee bread; So shalt thou save thy self and us relieve With Food, whereof we wretched seldom taste. He ended, and the Son of God reply&amp;#39;d. Think&amp;#39;st thou such force in Bread? is it not written (For I discern thee other then thou seem&amp;#39;st) Man lives not by Bread only, but each Word Proceeding from the mouth of God; who fed Our Fathers here with Manna; in the Mount Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank, And forty days Eliah without food Wandred this barren waste, the same I now. Why dost thou then suggest to me distrust, Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art? Whom thus answer&amp;#39;d th&amp;#39; Arch Fiend now undisguis&amp;#39;d. &amp;#39;Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate, Who leagu&amp;#39;d with millions more in rash revolt Kept not my happy Station, but was driv&amp;#39;n With them from bliss to the bottomless deep, Yet to that hideous place not so confin&amp;#39;d By rigour unconniving, but that oft Leaving my dolorous Prison I enjoy Large liberty to round this Globe of Earth, Or range in th&amp;#39; Air, nor from the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heav&amp;#39;ns Hath he excluded my resort sometimes. I came among the Sons of God, when he Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job To prove him, and illustrate his high worth; And when to all his Angels he propos&amp;#39;d To draw the proud King Ahab into fraud That he might fall in Ramoth, they demuring, I undertook that office, and the tongues Of all his flattering Prophets glibb&amp;#39;d with lyes To his destruction, as I had in charge. For what he bids I do; though I have lost Much lustre of my native brightness, lost To be belov&amp;#39;d of God, I have not lost To love, at least contemplate and admire What I see excellent in good, or fair, Or vertuous, I should so have lost all sense. What can be then less in me then desire To see thee and approach thee, whom I know Declar&amp;#39;d the Son of God, to hear attent Thy wisdom, and behold thy God-like deeds? Men generally think me much a foe To all mankind: why should I? they to me Never did wrong or violence, by them I lost not what I lost, rather by them I gain&amp;#39;d what I have gain&amp;#39;d, and with them dwell Copartner in these Regions of the World, If not disposer; lend them oft my aid, Oft my advice by presages and signs, And answers, oracles, portents and dreams, Whereby they may direct their future life. Envy they say excites me, thus to gain Companions of my misery and wo. At first it may be; but long since with wo Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof, That fellowship in pain divides not smart, Nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load. Small consolation then, were Man adjoyn&amp;#39;d: This wounds me most (what can it less) that Man, Man fall&amp;#39;n shall be restor&amp;#39;d, I never more. To whom our Saviour sternly thus reply&amp;#39;d. Deservedly thou griev&amp;#39;st, compos&amp;#39;d of lyes From the beginning, and in lies wilt end; Who boast&amp;#39;st release from Hell, and leave to come Into the Heav&amp;#39;n of Heavens; thou com&amp;#39;st indeed, As a poor miserable captive thrall, Comes to the place where he before had sat Among the Prime in Splendour, now depos&amp;#39;d, Ejected, emptyed, gaz&amp;#39;d, unpityed, shun&amp;#39;d, A spectacle of ruin or of scorn To all the Host of Heaven; the happy place Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy, Rather inflames thy torment, representing Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable, So never more in Hell then when in Heaven. But thou art serviceable to Heaven&amp;#39;s King. Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites? What but thy malice mov&amp;#39;d thee to misdeem Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him With all inflictions, but his patience won? The other service was thy chosen task, To be a lyer in four hundred mouths; For lying is thy sustenance, thy food. Yet thou pretend&amp;#39;st to truth; all Oracles By thee are giv&amp;#39;n, and what confest more true Among the Nations? that hath been thy craft, By mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes. But what have been thy answers, what but dark Ambiguous and with double sense deluding, Which they who ask&amp;#39;d have seldom understood, And not well understood as good not known? Who ever by consulting at thy shrine Return&amp;#39;d the wiser, or the more instruct To flye or follow what concern&amp;#39;d him most, And run not sooner to his fatal snare? For God hath justly giv&amp;#39;n the Nations up To thy Delusions; justly, since they fell Idolatrous, but when his purpose is Among them to declare his Providence To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth, But from him or his Angels President In every Province, who themselves disdaining To approach thy Temples, give thee in command What to the smallest tittle thou shalt say To thy Adorers; thou with trembling fear, Or like a Fawning Parasite obey&amp;#39;st; Then to thy self ascrib&amp;#39;st the truth fore-told. But this thy glory shall be soon retrench&amp;#39;d; No more shalt thou by oracling abuse The Gentiles; henceforth Oracles are ceast, And thou no more with Pomp and Sacrifice Shalt be enquir&amp;#39;d at Delphos or elsewhere, At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute. God hath now sent his living Oracle Into the World, to teach his final will, And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell In pious Hearts, an inward Oracle To all truth requisite for men to know. So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend, Though inly stung with anger and disdain, Dissembl&amp;#39;d, and this Answer smooth return&amp;#39;d. Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke, And urg&amp;#39;d me hard with doings, which not will But misery hath rested from me; where Easily canst thou find one miserable, And not inforc&amp;#39;d oft-times to part from truth; If it may stand him more in stead to lye, Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure? But thou art plac&amp;#39;t above me, thou art Lord; From thee I can and must submiss endure Check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit. Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk, Smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th&amp;#39; ear, And tuneable as Silvan Pipe or Song; What wonder then if I delight to hear Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire Vertue, who follow not her lore: permit me To hear thee when I come (since no man comes) And talk at least, though I despair to attain. Thy Father, who is holy, wise and pure, Suffers the Hypocrite or Atheous Priest To tread his Sacred Courts, and minister About his Altar, handling holy things, Praying or vowing, and vouchsaf&amp;#39;d his voice To Balaam Reprobate, a Prophet yet Inspir&amp;#39;d; disdain not such access to me. To whom our Saviour with unalter&amp;#39;d brow. Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope, I bid not or forbid; do as thou find&amp;#39;st Permission from above; thou canst not more. He added not; and Satan bowing low His gray dissimulation, disappear&amp;#39;d Into thin Air diffus&amp;#39;d: for now began Night with her sullen wing to double-shade The Desert, Fowls in thir clay nests were couch&amp;#39;t; And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;MEan while the new-baptiz&amp;#39;d, who yet remain&amp;#39;d At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen Him whom they heard so late expresly call&amp;#39;d Jesus Messiah Son of God declar&amp;#39;d, And on that high Authority had believ&amp;#39;d, And with him talkt, and with him lodg&amp;#39;d, I mean Andrew and Simon, famous after known With others though in Holy Writ not nam&amp;#39;d, Now missing him thir joy so lately found, So lately found, and so abruptly gone, Began to doubt, and doubted many days, And as the days increas&amp;#39;d, increas&amp;#39;d thir doubt: Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn, And for a time caught up to God, as once Moses was in the Mount, and missing long; And the great Thisbite who on fiery wheels Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come. Therefore as those young Prophets then with care Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico The City of Palms, Ænon, and Salem Old, Machærus and each Town or City wall&amp;#39;d On this side the broad lake Genezaret, Or in Perea, but return&amp;#39;d in vain. Then on the bank of Jordan, by a Creek: Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp&amp;#39;ring play Plain Fishermen, no greater men them call, Close in a Cottage low together got Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath&amp;#39;d. Alas, from what high hope to what relapse Unlook&amp;#39;d for are we fall&amp;#39;n, our eyes beheld Messiah certainly now come, so long Expected of our Fathers; we have heard His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth, Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand, The Kingdom shall to Israel be restor&amp;#39;d: Thus we rejoyc&amp;#39;d, but soon our joy is turn&amp;#39;d Into perplexity and new amaze: For whither is he gone, what accident Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire After appearance, and again prolong Our expectation? God of Israel, Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come; Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow&amp;#39;r unjust They have exalted, and behind them cast All fear of thee, arise and vindicate Thy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke, But let us wait; thus far he hath perform&amp;#39;d, Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal&amp;#39;d him, By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown, In publick, and with him we have convers&amp;#39;d; Let us be glad of this, and all our fears Lay on his Providence; he will not fail Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return. Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume To find whom at the first they found unsought: But to his Mother Mary, when she saw Others return&amp;#39;d from Baptism, not her Son, Nor left at Jordan, tydings of him none; Within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, Motherly cares and fears got head, and rais&amp;#39;d Some troubl&amp;#39;d thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad. O what avails me now that honour high To have conceiv&amp;#39;d of God, or that salute Hale highly favour&amp;#39;d, among women blest; While I to sorrows am no less advanc&amp;#39;t, And fears as eminent, above the lot Of other women, by the birth I bore, In such a season born when scarce a Shed Could be obtain&amp;#39;d to shelter him or me From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth, A Manger his, yet soon enforc&amp;#39;t to flye Thence into Egypt, till the Murd&amp;#39;rous King Were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill&amp;#39;d With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem; From Egypt home return&amp;#39;d, in Nazareth Hath been our dwelling many years, his life Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, Little suspicious to any King; but now Full grown to Man, acknowledg&amp;#39;d, as I hear, By John the Baptist, and in publick shown, Son own&amp;#39;d from Heaven by his Father&amp;#39;s voice; I look&amp;#39;t for some great change; to Honour? no, But trouble, as old Simeon plain fore-told, That to the fall and rising he should be Of many in Israel, and to a sign Spoken against, that through my very Soul A sword shall pierce, this is my favour&amp;#39;d lot, My Exaltation to Afflictions high; Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest; I will not argue that, nor will repine. But where delays he now? some great intent Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, I lost him, but so found, as well I saw He could not lose himself; but went about His Father&amp;#39;s business; what he meant I mus&amp;#39;d, Since understand; much more his absence now Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. But I to wait with patience am inur&amp;#39;d; My heart hath been a store-house long of things And sayings laid up, portending strange events. Thus Mary pondering oft, and oft to mind Recalling what remarkably had pass&amp;#39;d Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts Meekly compos&amp;#39;d awaited the fulfilling: The while her Son tracing the Desert wild, Sole but with holiest Meditations fed, Into himself descended, and at once All his great work to come before him set; How to begin, how to accomplish best His end of being on Earth, and mission high: For Satan with slye preface to return Had left him vacant, and with speed was gon Up to the middle Region of thick Air, Where all his Potentates in Council sate; There without sign of boast, or sign of joy, Sollicitous and blank he thus began. Princes, Heavens antient Sons, Æthereal Thrones, Demonian Spirits now, from the Element Each of his reign allotted, rightlier call&amp;#39;d, Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath, So may we hold our place and these mild seats Without new trouble; such an Enemy Is ris&amp;#39;n to invade us, who no less Threat&amp;#39;ns then our expulsion down to Hell; I, as I undertook, and with the vote Consenting in full frequence was impowr&amp;#39;d, Have found him, view&amp;#39;d him, tasted him, but find Far other labour to be undergon Then when I dealt with Adam first of Men, Though Adam by his Wives allurement fell, However to this Man inferior far, If he be Man by Mothers side at least, With more then humane gifts from Heaven adorn&amp;#39;d, Perfections absolute, Graces divine, And amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds. Therefore I am return&amp;#39;d, lest confidence Of my success with Eve in Paradise Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure Of like succeeding here; I summon all Rather to be in readiness, with hand Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst Thought none my equal, now be over-match&amp;#39;d. So spake the old Serpent doubting, and from all With clamour was assur&amp;#39;d thir utmost aid At his command; when from amidst them rose Belial the dissolutest Spirit that fell, The sensuallest, and after Asmodai The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advis&amp;#39;d. Set women in his eye and in his walk, Among daughters of men the fairest found; Many are in each Region passing fair As the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet, Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues Perswasive, Virgin majesty with mild And sweet allay&amp;#39;d, yet terrible to approach, Skill&amp;#39;d to retire, and in retiring draw Hearts after them tangl&amp;#39;d in Amorous Nets. Such object hath the power to soft&amp;#39;n and tame Severest temper, smooth the rugged&amp;#39;st brow, Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, Draw out with credulous desire, and lead At will the manliest, resolutest brest, As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws. Women, when nothing else, beguil&amp;#39;d the heart Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives. To whom quick answer Satan thus return&amp;#39;d. Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh&amp;#39;st All others by thy self; because of old Thou thy self doat&amp;#39;st on womankind, admiring Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, None are, thou think&amp;#39;st, but taken with such toys. Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew, False titl&amp;#39;d Sons of God, roaming the Earth Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, And coupl&amp;#39;d with them, and begot a race. Have we not seen, or by relation heard, In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk&amp;#39;st, In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side, In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more Too long, then lay&amp;#39;st thy scapes on names ador&amp;#39;d, Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan? But these haunts Delight not all; among the Sons of Men, How many have with a smile made small account Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn&amp;#39;d All her assaults, on worthier things intent? Remember that Pellean Conquerour, A youth, how all the Beauties of the East He slightly view&amp;#39;d, and slightly over-pass&amp;#39;d; How hee sirnam&amp;#39;d of Africa dismiss&amp;#39;d In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. For Solomon he liv&amp;#39;d at ease, and full Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim&amp;#39;d not beyond Higher design then to enjoy his State; Thence to the bait of Women lay expos&amp;#39;d; But he whom we attempt is wiser far Then Solomon, of more exalted mind, Made and set wholly on the accomplishment Of greatest things; what woman will you find, Though of this Age the wonder and the fame, On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye Of fond desire? or should she confident, As sitting Queen ador&amp;#39;d on Beauties Throne, Descend with all her winning charms begirt To enamour, as the Zone of Venus once Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables tell; How would one look from his Majestick brow Seated as on the top of Vertues hill, Discount&amp;#39;nance her despis&amp;#39;d, and put to rout All her array; her female pride deject, Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands In the admiration only of weak minds Led captive; cease to admire, and all her Plumes Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, At every sudden slighting quite abasht: Therefore with manlier objects we must try His constancy, with such as have more shew Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck&amp;#39;d; Or that which only seems to satisfie Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond; And now I know he hungers where no food Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness; The rest commit to me, I shall let pass No advantage, and his strength as oft assay. He ceas&amp;#39;d, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band Of Spirits likest to himself in guile To be at hand, and at his beck appear, If cause were to unfold some active Scene Of various persons each to know his part; Then to the Desert takes with these his flight; Where still from shade to shade the Son of God After forty days fasting had remain&amp;#39;d, Now hungring first, and to himself thus said. Where will this end? four times ten days I have pass&amp;#39;d Wandring this woody maze, and humane food Nor tasted, nor had appetite; that Fast To Vertue I impute not, or count part Of what I suffer here; if Nature need not, Or God support Nature without repast Though needing, what praise is it to endure? But now I feel I hunger, which declares, Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God Can satisfie that need some other way, Though hunger still remain: so it remain Without this bodies wasting, I content me, And from the sting of Famine fear no harm, Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will. It was the hour of night, when thus the Son Commun&amp;#39;d in silent walk, then laid him down Under the hospitable covert nigh Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept, And dream&amp;#39;d, as appetite is wont to dream, Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet; Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood And saw the Ravens with their horny beaks Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn, Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: He saw the Prophet also how he fled Into the Desert, and how there he slept Under a Juniper; then how awakt, He found his Supper on the coals prepar&amp;#39;d, And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, And eat the second time after repose, The strength whereof suffic&amp;#39;d him forty days; Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak&amp;#39;d. Up to a hill anon his steps he rear&amp;#39;d, From whose high top to ken the prospect round, If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd; But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw, Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove, With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud; Thither he bent his way, determin&amp;#39;d there To rest at noon, and entr&amp;#39;d soon the shade High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown That open&amp;#39;d in the midst a woody Scene, Natures own work it seem&amp;#39;d (Nature taught Art) And to a Superstitious eye the haunt Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view&amp;#39;d it round, When suddenly a man before him stood, Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred, And with fair speech these words to him address&amp;#39;d. With granted leave officious I return, But much more wonder that the Son of God In this wild solitude so long should bide Of all things destitute, and well I know, Not without hunger. Others of some note, As story tells, have trod this Wilderness; The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he relief By a providing Angel; all the race Of Israel here had famish&amp;#39;d, had not God Rain&amp;#39;d from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold Native of Thebes wandring here was fed Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. Of thee these forty days none hath regard, Forty and more deserted here indeed. To whom thus Jesus; what conclud&amp;#39;st thou hence? They all had need, I as thou seest have none. How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply&amp;#39;d, Tell me if Food were now before thee set, Would&amp;#39;st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like The giver, answer&amp;#39;d Jesus. Why should that Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend, Hast thou not right to all Created things, Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee Duty and Service, nor to stay till bid, But tender all their power? nor mention I Meats by the Law unclean, or offer&amp;#39;d first To Idols, those young Daniel could refuse; Nor proffer&amp;#39;d by an Enemy, though who Would scruple that, with want opprest? behold Nature asham&amp;#39;d, or better to express, Troubl&amp;#39;d that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey&amp;#39;d From all the Elements her choicest store To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord With honour, only deign to sit and eat. He spake no dream, for as his words had end, Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld In ample space under the broadest shade A Table richly spred, in regal mode, With dishes pill&amp;#39;d, and meats of noblest sort And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game, In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl&amp;#39;d, Gris-amber-steam&amp;#39;d; all Fish from Sea or Shore, Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, And exquisitest name, for which was drain&amp;#39;d Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. Alas how simple, to these Cates compar&amp;#39;d, Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! And at a stately side-board by the wine That fragrant smell diffus&amp;#39;d, in order stood Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant more Under the Trees now trip&amp;#39;d, now solemn stood Nymphs of Diana&amp;#39;s train, and Naiades With fruits and flowers from Amalthea&amp;#39;s horn, And Ladies of th&amp;#39; Hesperides, that seem&amp;#39;d Fairer then feign&amp;#39;d of old, or fabl&amp;#39;d since Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann&amp;#39;d From their soft wings, and Flora&amp;#39;s earliest smells. Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now His invitation earnestly renew&amp;#39;d. What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict Defends the touching of these viands pure, Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, But life preserves, destroys life&amp;#39;s enemy, Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. All these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs, Thy gentle Ministers, who come to pay Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord: What doubt&amp;#39;st thou Son of God? sit down and eat. To whom thus Jesus temperately reply&amp;#39;d: Said&amp;#39;st thou not that to all things I had right? And who withholds my pow&amp;#39;r that right to use? Shall I receive by gift what of my own, When and where likes me best, I can command? I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, Command a Table in this Wilderness, And call swift flights of Angels ministrant Array&amp;#39;d in Glory on my cup to attend: Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, In vain, where no acceptance it can find, And with my hunger what has thou to do? Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn, And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles. To whom thus answer&amp;#39;d Satan malecontent: That I have also power to give thou seest, If of that pow&amp;#39;r I bring thee voluntary What I might have bestow&amp;#39;d on whom I pleas&amp;#39;d, And rather opportunely in this place Chose to impart to thy apparent need, Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see What I can do or offer is suspect; Of these things others quickly will dispose Whose pains have earn&amp;#39;d the far fet spoil. With that Both Table and Provision vanish&amp;#39;d quite With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard; Only the importune Tempter still remain&amp;#39;d, And with these words his temptation pursu&amp;#39;d. By hunger, that each other Creature tames, Thou art not to be harm&amp;#39;d, therefore not mov&amp;#39;d; Thy temperance invincible besides, For no allurement yields to appetite, And all thy heart is set on high designs, High actions; but wherewith to be atchiev&amp;#39;d? Great acts require great means of enterprise, Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, A Carpenter thy Father known, thy self Bred up in poverty and streights at home; Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit: Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire To greatness? whence Authority deriv&amp;#39;st, What Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain, Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude, Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms; What rais&amp;#39;d Antipater the Edomite, And his Son Herod plac&amp;#39;d on Juda&amp;#39;s Throne; (Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap, Not difficult, if thou hearken to me, Riches are mine, Fortune is in my hand; They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want. To whom thus Jesus patiently reply&amp;#39;d; Yet Wealth without these three is impotent, To gain dominion or to keep it gain&amp;#39;d. Witness those antient Empires of the Earth, In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv&amp;#39;d: But men endu&amp;#39;d with these have oft attain&amp;#39;d In lowest poverty to highest deeds; Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad, Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat So many Ages, and shall yet regain That seat, and reign in Israel without end. Among the Heathen, (for throughout the World To me is not unknown what hath been done Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? For I esteem those names of men so poor Who could do mighty things, and could contemn Riches though offer&amp;#39;d from the hand of Kings. And what in me seems wanting, but that I May also in this poverty as soon Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? Extol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools, The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. What if with like aversion I reject Riches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown, Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights To him who wears the Regal Diadem, When on his shoulders each mans burden lies; For therein stands the office of a King, His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise, That for the Publick all this weight he bears. Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; Which every wise and vertuous man attains: And who attains not, ill aspires to rule Cities of men or head-strong Multitudes, Subject himself to Anarchy within, Or lawless passions in him which he serves. But to guide Nations in the way of truth By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead To know, and knowing worship God aright, Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul, Governs the inner man, the nobler part, That other o&amp;#39;re the body only reigns, And oft by force, which to a generous mind So reigning can be no sincere delight. Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought Greater and nobler done, and to lay down Far more magnanimous, then to assume. Riches are needless then, both for themselves, And for thy reason why they should be sought, To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss&amp;#39;t.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;SO spake the Son of God, and Satan stood A while as mute confounded what to say, What to reply, confuted and convinc&amp;#39;t Of his weak arguing, and fallacious drift; At length collecting all his Serpent wiles, With soothing words renew&amp;#39;d, him thus accosts. I see thou know&amp;#39;st what is of use to know, What best to say canst say, to do canst do; Thy actions to thy words accord, thy words To thy large heart give utterance due, thy heart Conteins of good, wise, just, the perfect shape. Should Kings and Nations from thy mouth consult, Thy Counsel would be as the Oracle Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems On Aaron&amp;#39;s breast: or tongue of Seers old Infallible; or wert thou sought to deeds That might require th&amp;#39; array of war, thy skill Of conduct would be such, that all the world Could not sustain thy Prowess, or subsist In battel, though against thy few in arms. These God-like Vertues wherefore dost thou hide? Affecting private life, or more obscure In savage Wilderness, wherefore deprive All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thy self The fame and glory, glory the reward That sole excites to high attempts the flame Of most erected Spirits, most temper&amp;#39;d pure Ætherial, who all pleasures else despise, All treasures and all gain esteem as dross, And dignities and powers all but the highest? Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe, the Son Of Macedonian Philip had e&amp;#39;re these Won Asia and the Throne of Cyrus held At his dispose, young Scipio had brought down The Carthaginian pride, young Pompey quell&amp;#39;d The Pontic King and in triumph had rode. Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature, Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment. Great Julius, whom now all the world admires The more he grew in years, the more inflam&amp;#39;d With glory, wept that he had liv&amp;#39;d so long Inglorious: but thou yet art not too late. To whom our Saviour calmly thus reply&amp;#39;d. Thou neither dost perswade me to seek wealth For Empires sake, nor Empire to affect For glories sake by all thy argument. For what is glory but the blaze of fame, The peoples praise, if always praise unmixt? And what the people but a herd confus&amp;#39;d, A miscellaneous rabble, who extol Things vulgar, &amp;amp; well weigh&amp;#39;d, scarce worth the praise, They praise and they admire they know not what; And know not whom, but as one leads the other; And what delight to be by such extoll&amp;#39;d, To live upon thir tongues and be thir talk, Of whom to be disprais&amp;#39;d were no small praise? His lot who dares be singularly good. Th&amp;#39; intelligent among them and the wise Are few, and glory scarce of few is rais&amp;#39;d. This is true glory and renown, when God Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks The just man, and divulges him through Heaven To all his Angels, who with true applause Recount his praises; thus he did to Job, When to extend his fame through Heaven &amp;amp; Earth, As thou to thy reproach mayst well remember, He ask&amp;#39;d thee, hast thou seen my servant Job? Famous he was in Heaven, on Earth less known; Where glory is false glory, attributed To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame. They err who count it glorious to subdue By Conquest far and wide, to over-run Large Countries, and in field great Battels win, Great Cities by assault: what do these Worthies, But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave Peaceable Nations, neighbouring, or remote, Made Captive, yet deserving freedom more Then those thir Conquerours, who leave behind Nothing but ruin wheresoe&amp;#39;re they rove, And all the flourishing works of peace destroy, Then swell with pride, and must be titl&amp;#39;d Gods, Great Benefactors of mankind, Deliverers, Worship&amp;#39;t with Temple, Priest and Sacrifice; One is the Son of Jove, of Mars the other, Till Conquerour Death discover them scarce men, Rowling in brutish vices, and deform&amp;#39;d, Violent or shameful death thir due reward. But if there be in glory aught of good, It may by means far different be attain&amp;#39;d Without ambition, war, or violence; By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent, By patience, temperance; I mention still Him whom thy wrongs with Saintly patience born, Made famous in a Land and times obscure; Who names not now with honour patient Job? Poor Socrates (who next more memorable?) By what he taught and suffer&amp;#39;d for so doing, For truths sake suffering death unjust, lives now Equal in fame to proudest Conquerours. Yet if for fame and glory aught be done, Aught suffer&amp;#39;d; if young African for fame His wasted Country freed from Punic rage, The deed becomes unprais&amp;#39;d, the man at least, And loses, though but verbal, his reward. Shall I seek glory then, as vain men seek Oft not deserv&amp;#39;d? I seek not mine, but his Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am. To whom the Tempter murmuring thus reply&amp;#39;d. Think not so slight of glory; therein least Resembling thy great Father: he seeks glory, And for his glory all things made, all things Orders and governs, nor content in Heaven By all his Angels glorifi&amp;#39;d, requires Glory from men, from all men good or bad, Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption; Above all Sacrifice, or hallow&amp;#39;d gift Glory he requires, and glory he receives Promiscuous from all Nations, Jew, or Greek, Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declar&amp;#39;d; From us his foes pronounc&amp;#39;t glory he exacts. To whom our Saviour fervently reply&amp;#39;d. And reason; since his word all things produc&amp;#39;d, Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, But to shew forth his goodness, and impart His good communicable to every soul Freely; of whom what could he less expect Then glory and benediction, that is thanks, The slightest, easiest, readiest recompence From them who could return him nothing else, And not returning that would likeliest render Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? Hard recompence, unsutable return For so much good, so much beneficence. But why should man seek glory? who of his own Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation, ignominy, and shame? Who for so many benefits receiv&amp;#39;d Turn&amp;#39;d recreant to God, ingrate and false, And so of all true good himself despoil&amp;#39;d, Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take That which to God alone of right belongs; Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace, That who advance his glory, not thir own, Them he himself to glory will advance. So spake the Son of God; and here again Satan had not to answer, but stood struck With guilt of his own sin, for he himself Insatiable of glory had lost all, Yet of another Plea bethought him soon. Of glory as thou wilt, said he, so deem, Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass: But to a Kingdom thou art born, ordain&amp;#39;d To sit upon thy Father David&amp;#39;s Throne; By Mothers side thy Father, though thy right Be now in powerful hands, that will not part Easily from possession won with arms; Judæa now and all the promis&amp;#39;d land Reduc&amp;#39;t a Province under Roman yoke, Obeys Tiberius; nor is always rul&amp;#39;d With temperate sway; oft have they violated The Temple, oft the Law with foul affronts, Abominations rather, as did once Antiochus: and think&amp;#39;st thou to regain Thy right by sitting still or thus retiring? So did not Machabeus: he indeed Retir&amp;#39;d unto the Desert, but with arms; And o&amp;#39;re a mighty King so oft prevail&amp;#39;d, That by strong hand his Family obtain&amp;#39;d, Though Priests, the Crown, and David&amp;#39;s Throne usurp&amp;#39;d, With Modin and her Suburbs once content. If Kingdom move thee not, let move thee Zeal, And Duty; Zeal and Duty are not slow; But on Occasions forelock watchful wait. They themselves rather are occasion best, Zeal of thy Fathers house, Duty to free Thy Country from her Heathen servitude; So shalt thou best fullfil, best verifie The Prophets old, who sung thy endless raign, The happier raign the sooner it begins, Raign then; what canst thou better do the while? To whom our Saviour answer thus return&amp;#39;d. All things are best fullfil&amp;#39;d in their due time, And time there is for all things, Truth hath said: If of my raign Prophetic Writ hath told, That it shall never end, so when begin The Father in his purpose hath decreed, He in whose hand all times and seasons roul. What if he hath decreed that I shall first Be try&amp;#39;d in humble state, and things adverse, By tribulations, injuries, insults, Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence, Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting Without distrust or doubt, that he may know What I can suffer, how obey? who best Can suffer, best can do; best reign, who first Well hath obey&amp;#39;d; just tryal e&amp;#39;re I merit My exaltation without change or end. But what concerns it thee when I begin My everlasting Kingdom, why art thou Sollicitous, what moves thy inquisition? Know&amp;#39;st thou not that my rising is thy fall, And my promotion will be thy destruction? To whom the Tempter inly rackt reply&amp;#39;d. Let that come when it comes; all hope is lost Of my reception into grace; what worse? For where no hope is left, is left no fear; If there be worse, the expectation more Of worse torments me then the feeling can. I would be at the worst; worst is my Port, My harbour and my ultimate repose, The end I would attain, my final good. My error was my error and my crime My crime; whatever for it self condemn&amp;#39;d, And will alike be punish&amp;#39;d; whether thou Raign or raign not; though to that gentle brow Willingly I could flye, and hope thy raign, From that placid aspect and meek regard, Rather then aggravate my evil state, Would stand between me and thy Fathers ire, (Whose ire I dread more then the fire of Hell) A shelter and a kind of shading cool Interposition, as a summers cloud. If I then to the worst that can be hast, Why move thy feet so slow to what is best, Happiest both to thy self and all the world, That thou who worthiest art should&amp;#39;st be thir King? Perhaps thou linger&amp;#39;st in deep thoughts detain&amp;#39;d Of the enterprize so hazardous and high; No wonder, for though in thee be united What of perfection can in man be found, Or human nature can receive, consider Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent At home, scarce view&amp;#39;d the Gallilean Towns, And once a year Jerusalem, few days Short sojourn; and what thence could&amp;#39;st thou observe? The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory, Empires, and Monarchs, and thir radiant Courts, Best school of best experience, quickest in sight In all things that to greatest actions lead. The wisest, unexperienc&amp;#39;t, will be ever Timorous and loth, with novice modesty, (As he who seeking Asses found a Kingdom) Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous: But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes The Monarchies of the Earth, thir pomp and state, Sufficient introduction to inform Thee, of thy self so apt, in regal Arts, And regal Mysteries; that thou may&amp;#39;st know How best their opposition to withstand. With that (such power was giv&amp;#39;n him then) he took The Son of God up to a Mountain high. It was a Mountain at whose verdant feet A spatious plain out stretch&amp;#39;t in circuit wide Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flow&amp;#39;d, Th&amp;#39; one winding, the other strait and left between Fair Champain with less rivers interveind, Then meeting joyn&amp;#39;d thir tribute to the Sea: Fertil of corn the glebe, of oyl and wine, With herds the pastures throng&amp;#39;d, with flocks the hills, Huge Cities and high towr&amp;#39;d, that well might seem The seats of mightiest Monarchs, and so large The Prospect was, that here and there was room For barren desert fountainless and dry. To this high mountain top the Tempter brought Our Saviour, and new train of words began. Well have we speeded, and o&amp;#39;re hill and dale, Forest and field, and flood, Temples and Towers Cut shorter many a league; here thou behold&amp;#39;st Assyria and her Empires antient bounds, Araxes and the Caspian lake, thence on As far as Indus East, Euphrates West, And oft beyond; to South the Persian Bay, And inaccessible the Arabian drouth: Here Ninevee, of length within her wall Several days journey, built by Ninus old, Of that first golden Monarchy the seat, And seat of Salmanassar, whose success Israel in long captivity still mourns; There Babylon the wonder of all tongues, As antient, but rebuilt by him who twice Judah and all thy Father David&amp;#39;s house Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis His City there thou seest, and Bactra there; Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates, There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, The drink of none but Kings; of later fame Built by Emathian, or by Parthian hands, The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there Artaxata, Teredon, Tesiphon, Turning with easie eye thou may&amp;#39;st behold. All these the Parthian, now some Ages past, By great Arsaces led, who founded first That Empire, under his dominion holds From the luxurious Kings of Antioch won. And just in time thou com&amp;#39;st to have a view Of his great power; for now the Parthian King In Ctesiphon hath gather&amp;#39;d all his Host Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid He marches now in hast; see, though from far, His thousands, in what martial equipage They issue forth, Steel Bows, and Shafts their arms Of equal dread in flight, or in pursuit; All Horsemen, in which fight they most excel; See how in warlike muster they appear, In Rhombs and wedges, and half moons, and wings. He look&amp;#39;t and saw what numbers numberless The City gates out powr&amp;#39;d, light armed Troops In coats of Mail and military pride; In Mail thir horses clad, yet fleet and strong, Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice Of many Provinces from bound to bound; From Arachosia, from Candaor East, And Margiana to the Hyrcanian cliffs Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales, From Atropatia and the neighbouring plains Of Adiabene, Media, and the South Of Susiana to Balsara&amp;#39;s hav&amp;#39;n. He saw them in thir forms of battell rang&amp;#39;d, How quick they wheel&amp;#39;d, and flying behind them shot Sharp sleet of arrowie showers against the face Of thir pursuers, and overcame by flight; The field all iron cast a gleaming brown, Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor on each horn, Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight; Chariots or Elephants endorst with Towers Of Archers, nor of labouring Pioners A multitude with Spades and Axes arm&amp;#39;d To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, Or where plain was raise hill, or over-lay With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke; Mules after these, Camels and Dromedaries, And Waggons fraught with Utensils of war. Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, When Agrican with all his Northern powers Besieg&amp;#39;d Albracca, as Romances tell; The City of Gallaphrone, from thence to win The fairest of her Sex Angelica His daughter, sought by many Prowest Knights, Both Paynim, and the Peers of Charlemane. Such and so numerous was thir Chivalrie; At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presum&amp;#39;d, And to our Saviour thus his words renew&amp;#39;d. That thou may&amp;#39;st know I seek not to engage Thy Vertue, and not every way secure On no slight grounds thy safety; hear, and mark To what end I have brought thee hither and shewn All this fair sight; thy Kingdom though foretold By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou Endeavour, as thy Father David did, Thou never shalt obtain; prediction still In all things, and all men, supposes means, Without means us&amp;#39;d, what it predicts revokes. But say thou wer&amp;#39;t possess&amp;#39;d of David&amp;#39;s Throne By free consent of all, none opposite, Samaritan or Jew; how could&amp;#39;st thou hope Long to enjoy it quiet and secure, Between two such enclosing enemies Roman and Parthian? therefore one of these Thou must make sure thy own, the Parthian first By my advice, as nearer and of late Found able by invasion to annoy Thy country, and captive lead away her Kings Antigonus, and old Hyrcanus bound, Maugre the Roman: it shall be my task To render thee the Parthian at dispose; Chuse which thou wilt by conquest or by league. By him thou shalt regain, without him not, That which alone can truly reinstall thee In David&amp;#39;s royal seat, his true Successour, Deliverance of thy brethren, those ten Tribes Whose off-spring in his Territory yet serve In Habor, and among the Medes dispers&amp;#39;t, Ten Sons of Jacob, two of Joseph lost Thus long from Israel; serving as of old Thir Fathers in the land of Egypt serv&amp;#39;d, This offer sets before thee to deliver. These if from servitude thou shalt restore To thir inheritance, then, nor till then, Thou on the Throne of David in full glory, From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond Shalt raign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear. To whom our Saviour answer&amp;#39;d thus unmov&amp;#39;d. Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm, And fragile arms, much instrument of war Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, Before mine eyes thou hast set; and in my ear Vented much policy, and projects deep Of enemies, of aids, battels and leagues, Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. Means I must use thou say&amp;#39;st, prediction else Will unpredict and fail me of the Throne: My time I told thee, (and that time for thee Were better farthest off) is not yet come,; When that comes think not thou to find me slack On my part aught endeavouring, or to need Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome Luggage of war there shewn me, argument Of human weakness rather then of strength. My brethren, as thou call&amp;#39;st them; those Ten Tribes I must deliver, if I mean to raign David&amp;#39;s true heir, and his full Scepter sway To just extent over all Israel&amp;#39;s Sons; But whence to thee this zeal, where was it then For Israel, or for David, or his Throne, When thou stood&amp;#39;st up his Tempter to the pride Of numbring Israel, which cost the lives Of threescore and ten thousand Israelites By three days Pestilence? such was thy zeal To Israel then, the same that now to me. As for those captive Tribes, themselves were they Who wrought their own captivity, fell off From God to worship Calves, the Deities Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, And all the Idolatries of Heathen round, Besides thir other worse then heathenish crimes; Nor in the land of their captivity Humbled themselves, or penitent besought The God of their fore-fathers; but so dy&amp;#39;d Impenitent, and left a race behind Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce From Gentils, but by Circumcision vain, And God with Idols in their worship joyn&amp;#39;d. Should I of these the liberty regard, Who freed, as to their antient Patrimony, Unhumbl&amp;#39;d, unrepentant, unreform&amp;#39;d, Headlong would follow; and to thir Gods perhaps Of Bethel and of Dan? no, let them serve Thir enemies, who serve Idols with God. Yet he at length, time to himself best known, Remembring Abraham by some wond&amp;#39;rous call May bring them back repentant and sincere, And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, While to their native land with joy they hast, As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, When to the promis&amp;#39;d land thir Fathers pass&amp;#39;d; To his due time and providence I leave them. So spake Israel&amp;#39;s true King, and to the Fiend Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. So fares it when with truth falshood contends.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;PErplex&amp;#39;d and troubl&amp;#39;d at his bad success The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply, Discover&amp;#39;d in his fraud, thrown from his hope, So oft, and the perswasive Rhetoric That sleek&amp;#39;t his tongue, and won so much on Eve, So little here, nay lost; but Eve was Eve, This far his over-match, who self deceiv&amp;#39;d And rash, before-hand had no better weigh&amp;#39;d The strength he was to cope with, or his own: But as a man who had been matchless held In cunning, over-reach&amp;#39;t where least he thought, To salve his credit, and for very spight Still will be tempting him who foyls him still, And never cease, though to his shame the more; Or as a swarm of flies in vintage time, About the wine-press where sweet moust is powr&amp;#39;d, Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound; Or surging waves against a solid rock, Though all to shivers dash&amp;#39;t, the assault renew, Vain battry, and in froth or bubbles end; So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse Met ever; and to shameful silence brought, Yet gives not o&amp;#39;re though desperate of success, And his vain importunity pursues. He brought our Saviour to the western side Of that high mountain, whence he might behold Another plain, long but in bredth not wide; Wash&amp;#39;d by the Southern Sea, and on the North To equal length back&amp;#39;d with a ridge of hills That screen&amp;#39;d the fruits of the earth and seats of men From cold Septentrion blasts, thence in the midst Divided by a river, of whose banks On each side an Imperial City stood, With Towers and Temples proudly elevate On seven small Hills, with Palaces adorn&amp;#39;d, Porches and Theatres, Baths, Aqueducts, Statues and Trophees, and Triumphal Arcs, Gardens and Groves presented to his eyes, Above the highth of Mountains interpos&amp;#39;d. By what strange Parallax or Optic skill Of vision multiplyed through air, or glass Of Telescope, were curious to enquire: And now the Tempter thus his silence broke. The City which thou seest no other deem Then great and glorious Rome, Queen of the Earth So far renown&amp;#39;d, and with the spoils enricht Of Nations; there the Capitol thou seest Above the rest lifting his stately head On the Tarpeian rock, her Cittadel Impregnable, and there Mount Palatine The Imperial Palace, compass huge, and high The Structure, skill of noblest Architects, With gilded battlements, conspicuous far, Turrets and Terrases, and glittering Spires. Many a fair Edifice besides, more like Houses of Gods (so well I have dispos&amp;#39;d My Aerie Microscope) thou may&amp;#39;st behold Outside and inside both, pillars and roofs Carv&amp;#39;d work, the hand of fam&amp;#39;d Artificers In Cedar, Marble, Ivory or Gold. Thence to the gates cast round thine eye, and see What conflux issuing forth, or entring in, Pretors, Proconsuls to thir Provinces Hasting or on return, in robes of State; Lictors and rods the ensigns of thir power, Legions and Cohorts, turmes of horse and wings: Or Embassies from Regions far remote In various habits on the Appian road, Or on the Æmilian, some from farthest South, Syene, and where the shadow both way falls, Meroe Nilotic Isle, and more to West, The Realm of Bocchus to the Black-moor Sea; From the Asian Kings and Parthian among these, From India and the golden Chersoness, And utmost Indian Isle Taprobane, Dusk faces with white silken Turbants wreath&amp;#39;d: From Gallia, Gades, and the Brittish West, Germans and Scythians, and Sarmatians North Beyond Danubius to the Tauric Pool. All Nations now to Rome obedience pay, To Rome&amp;#39;s great Emperour, whose wide domain In ample Territory, wealth and power, Civility of Manners, Arts, and Arms, And long Renown thou justly may&amp;#39;st prefer Before the Parthian; these two Thrones except, The rest are barbarous, and scarce worth the sight, Shar&amp;#39;d among petty Kings too far remov&amp;#39;d; These having shewn thee, I have shewn thee all The Kingdoms of the world, and all thir glory. This Emperour hath no Son, and now is old, Old, and lascivious, and from Rome retir&amp;#39;d To Capreæ an Island small but strong On the Campanian shore, with purpose there His horrid lusts in private to enjoy, Committing to a wicked Favourite All publick cares, and yet of him suspicious, Hated of all, and hating; with what ease Indu&amp;#39;d with Regal Vertues as thou art, Appearing, and beginning noble deeds, Might&amp;#39;st thou expel this monster from his Throne Now made a stye, and in his place ascending A victor, people free from servile yoke? And with my help thou may&amp;#39;st; to me the power Is given, and by that right I give it thee. Aim therefore at no less then all the world, Aim at the highest, without the highest attain&amp;#39;d Will be for thee no sitting, or not long On David&amp;#39;s Throne, be propheci&amp;#39;d what will. To whom the Son of God unmov&amp;#39;d reply&amp;#39;d. Nor doth this grandeur and majestic show Of luxury, though call&amp;#39;d magnificence, More then of arms before, allure mine eye, Much less my mind; though thou should&amp;#39;st add to tell Thir sumptuous gluttonies, and gorgeous feasts On Cittron tables or Atlantic stone; (For I have also heard, perhaps have read) Their wines of Setia, Cales, and Falerne, Chios and Creet, and how they quaff in Gold, Crystal and Myrrhine cups imboss&amp;#39;d with Gems And studs of Pearl, to me should&amp;#39;st tell who thirst And hunger still: then Embassies thou shew&amp;#39;st From Nations far and nigh; what honour that, But tedious wast of time to sit and hear So many hollow complements and lies, Outlandish flatteries? then proceed&amp;#39;st to talk Of the Emperour, how easily subdu&amp;#39;d, How gloriously; I shall, thou say&amp;#39;st, expel A brutish monster: what if I withal Expel a Devil who first made him such? Let his tormenter Conscience find him out, For him I was not sent, nor yet to free That people victor once, now vile and base, Deservedly made vassal, who once just, Frugal, and mild, and temperate, conquer&amp;#39;d well, But govern ill the Nations under yoke, Peeling thir Provinces, exhausted all By lust and rapine; first ambitious grown Of triumph that insulting vanity; Then cruel, by thir sports to blood enur&amp;#39;d Of fighting beasts, and men to beasts expos&amp;#39;d, Luxurious by thir wealth, and greedier still, And from the daily Scene effeminate. What wise and valiant man would seek to free These thus degenerate, by themselves enslav&amp;#39;d, Or could of inward slaves make outward free? Know therefore when my season comes to sit On David&amp;#39;s Throne, it shall be like a tree Spreading and over-shadowing all the Earth, Or as a stone that shall to pieces dash All Monarchies besides throughout the world, And of my Kingdom there shall be no end: Means there shall be to this, but what the means, Is not for thee to know, nor me to tell. To whom the Tempter impudent repli&amp;#39;d. I see all offers made by me how slight Thou valu&amp;#39;st, because offer&amp;#39;d, and reject&amp;#39;st: Nothing will please the difficult and nice, Or nothing more then still to contradict: On the other side know also thou, that I On what I offer set as high esteem, Nor what I part with mean to give for naught; All these which in a moment thou behold&amp;#39;st, The Kingdoms of the world to thee I give; For giv&amp;#39;n to me, I give to whom I please, No trifle; yet with this reserve, not else, On this condition, if thou wilt fall down, And worship me as thy superior Lord, Easily done, and hold them all of me; For what can less so great a gift deserve? Whom thus our Saviour answer&amp;#39;d with disdain. I never lik&amp;#39;d thy talk, thy offers less, Now both abhor, since thou hast dar&amp;#39;d to utter The abominable terms, impious condition; But I endure the time, till which expir&amp;#39;d, Thou hast permission on me. It is written The first of all Commandments, Thou shalt worship The Lord thy God, and only him shalt serve; And dar&amp;#39;st thou to the Son of God propound To worship thee accurst, now more accurst For this attempt bolder then that on Eve, And more blasphemous? which expect to rue. The Kingdoms of the world to thee were giv&amp;#39;n, Permitted rather, and by thee usurp&amp;#39;t, Other donation none thou canst produce: If given, by whom but by the King of Kings, God over all supreme? if giv&amp;#39;n to thee, By thee how fairly is the Giver now Repaid? But gratitude in thee is lost Long since. Wert thou so void of fear or shame, As offer them to me the Son of God, To me my own, on such abhorred pact, That I fall down and worship thee as God? Get thee behind me; plain thou now appear&amp;#39;st That Evil one, Satan for ever damn&amp;#39;d. To whom the Fiend with fear abasht reply&amp;#39;d. Be not so sore offended, Son of God; Though Sons of God both Angels are and Men, If I to try whether in higher sort Then these thou bear&amp;#39;st that title, have propos&amp;#39;d What both from Men and Angels I receive, Tetrarchs of fire, air, flood, and on the earth Nations besides from all the quarter&amp;#39;d winds, God of this world invok&amp;#39;t and world beneath; Who then thou art, whose coming is foretold To me so fatal, me it most concerns. The tryal hath indamag&amp;#39;d thee no way, Rather more honour left and more esteem; Me naught advantag&amp;#39;d, missing what I aim&amp;#39;d. Therefore let pass, as they are transitory, The Kingdoms of this world; I shall no more Advise thee, gain them as thou canst, or not. And thou thy self seem&amp;#39;st otherwise inclin&amp;#39;d Then to a worldly Crown, addicted more To contemplation and profound dispute, As by that early action may be judg&amp;#39;d, When slipping from thy Mothers eye thou went&amp;#39;st Alone into the Temple; there was found Among the gravest Rabbies disputant On points and questions fitting Moses Chair, Teaching not taught; the childhood shews the man, As morning shews the day. Be famous then By wisdom; as thy Empire must extend, So let extend thy mind o&amp;#39;re all the world, In knowledge, all things in it comprehend, All knowledge is not couch&amp;#39;t in Moses Law, The Pentateuch or what the Prophets wrote, The Gentiles also know, and write, and teach To admiration, led by Natures light; And with the Gentiles much thou must converse, Ruling them by perswasion as thou mean&amp;#39;st, Without thir learning how wilt thou with them, Or they with thee hold conversation meet? How wilt thou reason with them, how refute Thir Idolisms, Traditions, Paradoxes? Error by his own arms is best evinc&amp;#39;t. Look once more e&amp;#39;re we leave this specular Mount Westward, much nearer by Southwest, behold Where on the Ægean shore a City stands Built nobly, pure the air, and light the soil, Athens the eye of Greece, Mother of Arts And Eloquence, native to famous wits Or hospitable, in her sweet recess, City or Suburban, studious walks and shades; See there the Olive Grove of Academe, Plato&amp;#39;s retirement, where the Attic Bird Trills her thick-warbl&amp;#39;d notes the summer long, There flowrie hill Hymettus with the sound Of Bees industrious murmur oft invites To studious musing; there Ilissus rouls His whispering stream; within the walls then view The schools of antient Sages; his who bred Great Alexander to subdue the world, Lyceum there, and painted Stoa next: There thou shalt hear and learn the secret power Of harmony in tones and numbers hit By voice or hand, and various-measur&amp;#39;d verse, Æolian charms and Dorian Lyric Odes, And his who gave them breath, but higher sung, Blind Melesigenes thence Homer call&amp;#39;d, Whose Poem Phoebus challeng&amp;#39;d for his own. Thence what the lofty grave Tragoedians taught In Chorus or Iambic, teachers best Of moral prudence, with delight receiv&amp;#39;d In brief sententious precepts, while they treat Of fate, and chance, and change in human life; High actions, and high passions best describing: Thence to the famous Orators repair, Those antient, whose resistless eloquence Wielded at will that fierce Democratie, Shook the Arsenal and fulmin&amp;#39;d over Greece, To Macedon, and Artaxerxes Throne; To sage Philosophy next lend thine ear, From Heaven descended to the low-rooft house Of Socrates, see there his Tenement, Whom well inspir&amp;#39;d the Oracle pronounc&amp;#39;d Wisest of men; from whose mouth issu&amp;#39;d forth Mellifluous streams that water&amp;#39;d all the schools Of Academics old and new, with those Sirnam&amp;#39;d Peripatetics, and the Sect Epicurean, and the Stoic severe; These here revolve, or, as thou lik&amp;#39;st, at home, Till time mature thee to a Kingdom&amp;#39;s waight; These rules will render thee a King compleat Within thy self, much more with Empire joyn&amp;#39;d. To whom our Saviour sagely thus repli&amp;#39;d. Think not but that I know these things, or think I know them not; not therefore am I short Of knowing what I aught: he who receives Light from above, from the fountain of light, No other doctrine needs, though granted true; But these are false, or little else but dreams, Conjectures, fancies, built on nothing firm. The first and wisest of them all profess&amp;#39;d To know this only, that he nothing knew; The next to fabling fell and smooth conceits, A third sort doubted all things, though plain sence; Others in vertue plac&amp;#39;d felicity, But vertue joyn&amp;#39;d with riches and long life, In corporal pleasure he, and careless ease, The Stoic last in Philosophic pride, By him call&amp;#39;d vertue; and his vertuous man, Wise, perfect in himself, and all possessing Equal to God, oft shames not to prefer, As fearing God nor man, contemning all Wealth, pleasure, pain or torment, death and life, Which when he lists, he leaves, or boasts he can, For all his tedious talk is but vain boast, Or subtle shifts conviction to evade. Alas what can they teach, and not mislead; Ignorant of themselves, of God much more, And how the world began, and how man fell Degraded by himself, on grace depending? Much of the Soul they talk, but all awrie, And in themselves seek vertue, and to themselves All glory arrogate, to God give none, Rather accuse him under usual names, Fortune and Fate, as one regardless quite Of mortal things. Who therefore seeks in these True wisdom, finds her not, or by delusion Far worse, her false resemblance only meets, An empty cloud. However many books Wise men have said are wearisom; who reads Incessantly, and to his reading brings not A spirit and judgment equal or superior, (And what he brings, what needs he elsewhere seek) Uncertain and unsettl&amp;#39;d still remains, Deep verst in books and shallow in himself, Crude or intoxicate, collecting toys, And trifles for choice matters, worth a spunge; As Children gathering pibles on the shore. Or if I would delight my private hours With Music or with Poem, where so soon As in our native Language can I find That solace? All our Law and Story strew&amp;#39;d With Hymns, our Psalms with artful terms inscrib&amp;#39;d, Our Hebrew Songs and Harps in Babylon, That pleas&amp;#39;d so well our Victors ear, declare That rather Greece from us these Arts deriv&amp;#39;d; Ill imitated, while they loudest sing The vices of thir Deities, and thir own In Fable, Hymn, or Song, so personating Thir Gods ridiculous, and themselves past shame. Remove their swelling Epithetes thick laid As varnish on a Harlots cheek, the rest, Thin sown with aught of profit or delight, Will far be found unworthy to compare With Sion&amp;#39;s songs, to all true tasts excelling, Where God is prais&amp;#39;d aright, and Godlike men, The Holiest of Holies, and his Saints; Such are from God inspir&amp;#39;d, not such from thee; Unless where moral vertue is express&amp;#39;t By light of Nature not in all quite lost. Thir Orators thou then extoll&amp;#39;st, as those The top of Eloquence, Statists indeed, And lovers of thir Country, as may seem; But herein to our Prophets far beneath, As men divinely taught, and better teaching The solid rules of Civil Government In thir majestic unaffected stile Then all the Oratory of Greece and Rome. In them is plainest taught, and easiest learnt, What makes a Nation happy, and keeps it so, What ruins Kingdoms, and lays Cities flat; These only with our Law best form a King. So spake the Son of God; but Satan now Quite at a loss, for all his darts were spent, Thus to our Saviour with stern brow reply&amp;#39;d. Since neither wealth, nor honour, arms nor arts, Kingdom nor Empire pleases thee, nor aught By me propos&amp;#39;d in life contemplative, Or active, tended on by glory, or fame, What dost thou in this World? the Wilderness For thee is fittest place, I found thee there, And thither will return thee, yet remember What I foretell thee, soon thou shalt have cause To wish thou never hadst rejected thus Nicely or cautiously my offer&amp;#39;d aid, Which would have set thee in short time with ease On David&amp;#39;s Throne; or Throne of all the world, Now at full age, fulness of time, thy season, When Prophesies of thee are best fullfill&amp;#39;d. Now contrary, if I read aught in Heaven, Or Heav&amp;#39;n write aught of Fate, by what the Stars Voluminous, or single characters, In their conjunction met, give me to spell, Sorrows, and labours, opposition, hate, Attends thee, scorns, reproaches, injuries, Violence and stripes, and lastly cruel death, A Kingdom they portend thee, but what Kingdom, Real or Allegoric I discern not, Nor when, eternal sure, as without end, Without beginning; for no date prefixt Directs me in the Starry Rubric set. So saying he took (for still he knew his power Not yet expir&amp;#39;d) and to the Wilderness Brought back the Son of God, and left him there, Feigning to disappear. Darkness now rose, As day-light sunk, and brought in lowring night Her shadowy off-spring unsubstantial both, Privation meer of light and absent day. Our Saviour meek and with untroubl&amp;#39;d mind After his aerie jaunt, though hurried sore, Hungry and cold betook him to his rest, Wherever, under some concourse of shades Whose branching arms thick intertwind might shield From dews and damps of night his shelter&amp;#39;d head, But shelter&amp;#39;d slept in vain, for at his head The Tempter watch&amp;#39;d, and soon with ugly dreams Disturb&amp;#39;d his sleep; and either Tropic now Gan thunder, and both ends of Heav&amp;#39;n, the Clouds From many a horrid rift abortive pour&amp;#39;d Fierce rain with lightning mixt, water with fire In ruine reconcil&amp;#39;d: nor slept the winds Within thir stony caves, but rush&amp;#39;d abroad From the four hinges of the world, and fell On the vext Wilderness, whose tallest Pines, Though rooted deep as high, and sturdiest Oaks Bow&amp;#39;d their Stiff necks, loaden with stormy blasts, Or torn up sheer: ill wast thou shrouded then, O patient Son of God, yet only stoodst Unshaken; nor yet staid the terror there, Infernal Ghosts, and Hellish Furies, round Environ&amp;#39;d thee, some howl&amp;#39;d, some yell&amp;#39;d, some shriek&amp;#39;d, Some bent at thee thir fiery darts, while thou Sat&amp;#39;st unappall&amp;#39;d in calm and sinless peace. Thus pass&amp;#39;d the night so foul till morning fair Came forth with Pilgrim steps in amice gray; Who with her radiant finger still&amp;#39;d the roar Of thunder, chas&amp;#39;d the clouds, and laid the winds, And grisly Spectres, which the Fiend had rais&amp;#39;d To tempt the Son of God with terrors dire. And now the Sun with more effectual beams Had chear&amp;#39;d the face of Earth, and dry&amp;#39;d the wet From drooping plant, or dropping tree; the birds Who all things now behold more fresh and green, After a night of storm so ruinous, Clear&amp;#39;d up their choicest notes in bush and spray To gratulate the sweet return of morn; Nor yet amidst this joy and brightest morn Was absent, after all his mischief done, The Prince of darkness, glad would also seem Of this fair change, and to our Saviour came, Yet with no new device, they all were spent, Rather by this his last affront resolv&amp;#39;d, Desperate of better course, to vent his rage, And mad despight to be so oft repell&amp;#39;d. Him walking on a Sunny hill he found, Back&amp;#39;d on the North and West by a thick wood, Out of the wood he starts in wonted shape; And in a careless mood thus to him said. Fair morning yet betides thee Son of God, After a dismal night; I heard the rack As Earth and Skie would mingle; but my self Was distant; and these flaws, though mortals fear them As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven, Or to the Earths dark basis underneath, Are to the main as inconsiderable, And harmless, if not wholsom, as a sneeze To mans less universe, and soon are gone; Yet as being oft times noxious where they light On man, beast, plant, wastful and turbulent, Like turbulencies in the affairs of men, Over whose heads they rore, and seem to point, They oft fore-signifie and threaten ill: This Tempest at this Desert most was bent; Of men at thee, for only thou here dwell&amp;#39;st. Did I not tell thee, if thou didst reject The perfet season offer&amp;#39;d with my aid To win thy destin&amp;#39;d seat, but wilt prolong All to the push of Fate, persue thy way Of gaining David&amp;#39;s Throne no man knows when, For both the when and how is no where told, Thou shalt be what thou art ordain&amp;#39;d, no doubt; For Angels have proclaim&amp;#39;d it, but concealing The time and means: each act is rightliest done, Not when it must, but when it may be best. If thou observe not this, be sure to find, What I foretold thee, many a hard assay Of dangers, and adversities and pains, E&amp;#39;re thou of Israel&amp;#39;s Scepter get fast hold; Whereof this ominous night that clos&amp;#39;d thee round, So many terrors, voices, prodigies May warn thee, as a sure fore-going sign. So talk&amp;#39;d he, while the Son of God went on And staid not, but in brief him answer&amp;#39;d thus. Mee worse then wet thou find&amp;#39;st not; other harm Those terrors which thou speak&amp;#39;st of, did me none; I never fear&amp;#39;d they could, though noising loud And threatning nigh; what they can do as signs Betok&amp;#39;ning, or ill boding, I contemn As false portents, not sent from God, but thee; Who knowing I shall raign past thy preventing, Obtrud&amp;#39;st thy offer&amp;#39;d aid, that I accepting At least might seem to hold all power of thee, Ambitious spirit, and wouldst be thought my God, And storm&amp;#39;st refus&amp;#39;d, thinking to terrifie Mee to thy will; desist, thou art discern&amp;#39;d And toil&amp;#39;st in vain, nor me in vain molest. To whom the Fiend now swoln with rage reply&amp;#39;d: Then hear, O Son of David, Virgin-born; For Son of God to me is yet in doubt, Of the Messiah I have heard foretold By all the Prophets; of thy birth at length Announc&amp;#39;t by Gabriel with the first I knew, And of the Angelic Song in Bethlehem field, On thy birth-night, that sung thee Saviour born. From that time seldom have I ceas&amp;#39;d to eye Thy infancy, thy childhood, and thy youth, Thy manhood last, though yet in private bred; Till at the Ford of Jordan whither all Flock&amp;#39;d to the Baptist, I among the rest, Though not to be Baptiz&amp;#39;d, by voice from Heav&amp;#39;n Heard thee pronounc&amp;#39;d the Son of God belov&amp;#39;d. Thenceforth I thought thee worth my nearer view And narrower Scrutiny, that I might learn In what degree or meaning thou art call&amp;#39;d The Son of God, which bears no single sence; The Son of God I also am, or was, And if I was, I am; relation stands; All men are Sons of God; yet thee I thought In some respect far higher so declar&amp;#39;d. Therefore I watch&amp;#39;d thy footsteps from that hour, And follow&amp;#39;d thee still on to this wast wild; Where by all best conjectures I collect Thou art to be my fatal enemy. Good reason then, if I before-hand seek To understand my Adversary, who And what he is; his wisdom, power, intent, By parl, or composition, truce, or league To win him, or win from him what I can. And opportunity I here have had To try thee, sift thee, and confess have found thee Proof against all temptation as a rock Of Adamant, and as a Center, firm To the utmost of meer man both wise and good, Not more; for Honours, Riches, Kingdoms, Glory Have been before contemn&amp;#39;d, and may agen: Therefore to know what more thou art then man, Worth naming Son of God by voice from Heav&amp;#39;n, Another method I must now begin. So saying he caught him up, and without wing Of Hippogrif bore through the Air sublime Over the Wilderness and o&amp;#39;re the Plain; Till underneath them fair Jerusalem, The holy City lifted high her Towers, And higher yet the glorious Temple rear&amp;#39;d Her pile, far off appearing like a Mount Of Alabaster, top&amp;#39;t with Golden Spires: There on the highest Pinacle he set The Son of God; and added thus in scorn: There stand, if thou wilt stand; to stand upright Will ask thee skill; I to thy Fathers house Have brought thee, and highest plac&amp;#39;t, highest is best, Now shew thy Progeny; if not to stand, Cast thy self down; safely if Son of God: For it is written, He will give command Concerning thee to his Angels, in thir hands They shall up lift thee, lest at any time Thou chance to dash thy foot against a stone. To whom thus Jesus: also it is written, Tempt not the Lord thy God, he said and stood. But Satan smitten with amazement fell As when Earths Son Antæus (to compare Small things with greatest) in Irassa strove With Joves Alcides, and oft foil&amp;#39;d still rose, Receiving from his mother Earth new strength, Fresh from his fall, and fiercer grapple joyn&amp;#39;d, Throttl&amp;#39;d at length in the Air, expir&amp;#39;d and fell; So after many a foil the Tempter proud, Renewing fresh assaults, amidst his pride Fell whence he stood to see his Victor fall. And as that Theban Monster that propos&amp;#39;d Her riddle, and him, who solv&amp;#39;d it not, devour&amp;#39;d; That once found out and solv&amp;#39;d, for grief and spight Cast her self headlong from th&amp;#39; Ismenian steep, So strook with dread and anguish fell the Fiend, And to his crew, that sat consulting, brought Joyless triumphals of his hop&amp;#39;t success, Ruin, and desperation, and dismay, Who durst so proudly tempt the Son of God. So Satan fell and strait a fiery Globe Of Angels on full sail of wing flew nigh, Who on their plumy Vans receiv&amp;#39;d him soft From his uneasie station, and upbore As on a floating couch through the blithe Air, Then in a flowry valley set him down On a green bank, and set before him spred A table of Celestial Food, Divine, Ambrosial, Fruits fetcht from the tree of life, And from the fount of life Ambrosial drink, That soon refresh&amp;#39;d him wearied, and repair&amp;#39;d What hunger, if aught hunger had impair&amp;#39;d, Or thirst, and as he fed, Angelic Quires Sung Heavenly Anthems of his victory Over temptation, and the Tempter proud. True Image of the Father whether thron&amp;#39;d In the bosom of bliss, and light of light Conceiving, or remote from Heaven, enshrin&amp;#39;d In fleshly Tabernacle, and human form, Wandring the Wilderness, whatever place, Habit, or state, or motion, still expressing The Son of God, with Godlike force indu&amp;#39;d Against th&amp;#39; Attempter of thy Fathers Throne, And Thief of Paradise; him long of old Thou didst debel, and down from Heav&amp;#39;n cast With all his Army, now thou hast aveng&amp;#39;d Supplanted Adam, and by vanquishing Temptation, hast regain&amp;#39;d lost Paradise, And frustrated the conquest fraudulent: He never more henceforth will dare set foot In Paradise to tempt; his snares are broke: For though that seat of earthly bliss be fail&amp;#39;d, A fairer Paradise is founded now For Adam and his chosen Sons, whom thou A Saviour art come down to re-install. Where they shall dwell secure, when time shall be Of Tempter and Temptation without fear. But thou, Infernal Serpent, shalt not long Rule in the Clouds; like an Autumnal Star Or Lightning thou shalt fall from Heav&amp;#39;n trod down Under his feet: for proof, e&amp;#39;re this thou feel&amp;#39;st Thy wound, yet not thy last and deadliest wound By this repulse receiv&amp;#39;d, and hold&amp;#39;st in Hell No triumph; in all her gates Abaddon rues Thy bold attempt; hereafter learn with awe To dread the Son of God: he all unarm&amp;#39;d Shall chase thee with the terror of his voice From thy Demoniac holds, possession foul, Thee and thy Legions, yelling they shall flye, And beg to hide them in a herd of Swine, Lest he command them down into the deep Bound, and to torment sent before thir time. Hail Son of the most High, heir of both worlds, Queller of Satan, on thy glorious work Now enter, and begin to save mankind. Thus they the Son of God our Saviour meek Sung Victor, and from Heavenly Feast refresht Brought on his way with joy; hee unobserv&amp;#39;d Home to his Mothers house private return&amp;#39;d.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;To Mr. Lawrence Lawrence, of virtuous father virtuous son, Now that the fields are dank, and ways are mire, Where shall we sometimes meet, and by the fire Help waste a sullen day; what may be won From the hard season gaining? Time will run On smoother, till Favonius re-inspire The frozen earth, and clothe in fresh attire The lily and rose, that neither sow&amp;#39;d nor spun. What neat repast shall feast us, light and choice, Of Attic taste, with wine, whence we may rise To hear the lute well touch&amp;#39;d, or artful voice Warble immortal notes and Tuscan air? He who of those delights can judge, and spare To interpose them oft, is not unwise.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;I did but prompt the age to quit their clogs By the known rules of ancient liberty, When straight a barbarous noise environs me Of owls and cuckoos, asses, apes and dogs: As when those hinds that were transform&amp;#39;d to frogs Rail&amp;#39;d at Latona&amp;#39;s twin-born progeny Which after held the sun and moon in fee. But this is got by casting pearl to hogs, That bawl for freedom in their senseless mood, And still revolt when truth would set them free. Licence they mean when they cry liberty; For who loves that, must first be wise and good. But from that mark how far they rove we see, For all this waste of wealth and loss of blood.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;To Mr. H. Lawes, On His Airs Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured song First taught our English music how to span Words with just note and accent, not to scan With Midas’ ears, committing short and long, Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng, With praise enough for Envy to look wan; To after-age thou shalt be writ the man That with smooth air couldst humor best our tongue. Thou honor’st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing To honor thee, the priest of Phœbus’ choir, That tun’st their happiest lines in hymn or story. Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher Than his Casella, whom he wooed to sing, Met in the milder shades of Purgatory.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;On the Lord General Fairfax at the Siege of Colchester Fairfax, whose name in arms through Europe rings Filling each mouth with envy, or with praise, And all her jealous monarchs with amaze And rumours loud, that daunt remotest kings; Thy firm unshak&amp;#39;n virtue ever brings Victory home, though new rebellions raise Their hydra heads, and the false north displays Her brok&amp;#39;n league, to imp their serpent wings: O yet a nobler task awaits thy hand; For what can war but endless war still breed? Till Truth and Right from Violence be freed, And Public Faith clear&amp;#39;d from the shameful brand Of Public Fraud. In vain doth Valour bleed While Avarice and Rapine share the land.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;To the Lord General Cromwell, May 1652,On the proposals of certain ministers at the Committee for Propagation of the Gospel Cromwell, our chief of men, who through a cloud Not of war only, but detractions rude, Guided by faith and matchless fortitude, To peace and truth thy glorious way hast plough&amp;#39;d, And on the neck of crowned Fortune proud Hast rear&amp;#39;d God&amp;#39;s trophies, and his work pursu&amp;#39;d, While Darwen stream with blood of Scots imbru&amp;#39;d, And Dunbar field, resounds thy praises loud, And Worcester&amp;#39;s laureate wreath; yet much remains To conquer still: peace hath her victories No less renown&amp;#39;d than war. New foes arise Threat&amp;#39;ning to bind our souls with secular chains: Help us to save free Conscience from the paw Of hireling wolves whose gospel is their maw.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;On the Late Massacre in Piedmont Avenge, O Lord, thy slaughter&amp;#39;d saints, whose bones Lie scatter&amp;#39;d on the Alpine mountains cold, Ev&amp;#39;n them who kept thy truth so pure of old, When all our fathers worshipp&amp;#39;d stocks and stones; Forget not: in thy book record their groans Who were thy sheep and in their ancient fold Slain by the bloody Piemontese that roll&amp;#39;d Mother with infant down the rocks. Their moans The vales redoubl&amp;#39;d to the hills, and they To Heav&amp;#39;n. Their martyr&amp;#39;d blood and ashes sow O&amp;#39;er all th&amp;#39; Italian fields where still doth sway The triple tyrant; that from these may grow A hundred-fold, who having learnt thy way Early may fly the Babylonian woe.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;When I consider how my light is spent, Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide, And that one Talent which is death to hide Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent To serve therewith my Maker, and present My true account, lest he returning chide; “Doth God exact day-labour, light denied?” I fondly ask. But patience, to prevent That murmur, soon replies, “God doth not need Either man’s work or his own gifts; who best Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed And post o’er Land and Ocean without rest: They also serve who only stand and wait.”&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;#39;Cyriack, whose grandsire on the royal bench Of British Themis, with no mean applause, Pronounced, and in his volumes taught, our laws, Which others at their bar so often wrench, Today deep thoughts resolve with me to drench In mirth that after no repenting draws; Let Euclid rest, and Archimedes pause, And what the Swede intend, and what the French. To measure life learn thou betimes, and know Toward solid good what leads the nearest way; For other things mild Heaven a time ordains, And disapproves that care, though wise in show, That with superfluous burden loads the day, And, when God sends a cheerful hour, refrains.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Cyriack, this three years&amp;#39; day these eyes, though clear To outward view of blemish or of spot, Bereft of light, their seeing have forgot; Nor to their idle orbs doth sight appear Of sun or moon or star throughout the year, Or man or woman. Yet I argue not Against Heav&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;s hand or will, not bate a jot Of heart or hope, but still bear up and steer Right onward. What supports me, dost thou ask? The conscience, friend, to have lost them overplied In liberty&amp;#39;s defence, my noble task, Of which all Europe talks from side to side. This thought might lead me through the world&amp;#39;s vain mask Content, though blind, had I no better guide.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Methought I saw my late espoused saint Brought to me, like Alcestis, from the grave, Whom Jove&amp;#39;s great son to her glad husband gave, Rescu&amp;#39;d from death by force, though pale and faint. Mine, as whom wash&amp;#39;d from spot of child-bed taint Purification in the old Law did save, And such as yet once more I trust to have Full sight of her in Heaven without restraint, Came vested all in white, pure as her mind; Her face was veil&amp;#39;d, yet to my fancied sight Love, sweetness, goodness, in her person shin&amp;#39;d So clear as in no face with more delight. But Oh! as to embrace me she inclin&amp;#39;d, I wak&amp;#39;d, she fled, and day brought back my night.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;,
 &lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, Stol&amp;#39;n on his wing my three-and-twentieth year! My hasting days fly on with full career, But my late spring no bud or blossom shew&amp;#39;th. Perhaps my semblance might deceive the truth That I to manhood am arriv&amp;#39;d so near; And inward ripeness doth much less appear, That some more timely-happy spirits endu&amp;#39;th. Yet be it less or more, or soon or slow, It shall be still in strictest measure ev&amp;#39;n To that same lot, however mean or high, Toward which Time leads me, and the will of Heav&amp;#39;n: All is, if I have grace to use it so As ever in my great Task-Master&amp;#39;s eye.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;]
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;I When moiling seems at cease In the vague void of night-time, And heaven&amp;#39;s wide roomage stormless Between the dusk and light-time, And fear at last is formless, We call the allurement Peace. II Peace, this hid riot, Change, This revel of quick-cued mumming, This never truly being, This evermore becoming, This spinner&amp;#39;s wheel onfleeing Outside perception&amp;#39;s range.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;(On the Signing of the Armistice, 11 Nov. 1918) I There had been years of Passion—scorching, cold, And much Despair, and Anger heaving high, Care whitely watching, Sorrows manifold, Among the young, among the weak and old, And the pensive Spirit of Pity whispered, “Why?” II Men had not paused to answer. Foes distraught Pierced the thinned peoples in a brute-like blindness, Philosophies that sages long had taught, And Selflessness, were as an unknown thought, And “Hell!” and “Shell!” were yapped at Lovingkindness. III The feeble folk at home had grown full-used To &amp;#39;dug-outs&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;snipers&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Huns&amp;#39;, from the war-adept In the mornings heard, and at evetides perused; To day-dreamt men in millions, when they mused— To nightmare-men in millions when they slept. IV Waking to wish existence timeless, null, Sirius they watched above where armies fell; He seemed to check his flapping when, in the lull Of night a boom came thencewise, like the dull Plunge of a stone dropped into some deep well. V So, when old hopes that earth was bettering slowly Were dead and damned, there sounded &amp;#39;War is done!&amp;#39; One morrow. Said the bereft, and meek, and lowly,&amp;#39;Will men some day be given to grace? yea, wholly, And in good sooth, as our dreams used to run?&amp;#39; VI Breathless they paused. Out there men raised their glance To where had stood those poplars lank and lopped, As they had raised it through the four years’ dance Of Death in the now familiar flats of France; And murmured, &amp;#39;Strange, this! How? All firing stopped?&amp;#39; VII Aye; all was hushed. The about-to-fire fired not, The aimed-at moved away in trance-lipped song. One checkless regiment slung a clinching shot And turned. The Spirit of Irony smirked out, &amp;#39;What? Spoil peradventures woven of Rage and Wrong?&amp;#39; VIII Thenceforth no flying fires inflamed the gray, No hurtlings shook the dewdrop from the thorn, No moan perplexed the mute bird on the spray; Worn horses mused: &amp;#39;We are not whipped to-day;&amp;#39; No weft-winged engines blurred the moon’s thin horn. IX Calm fell. From Heaven distilled a clemency; There was peace on earth, and silence in the sky; Some could, some could not, shake off misery: The Sinister Spirit sneered: &amp;#39;It had to be!&amp;#39; And again the Spirit of Pity whispered, &amp;#39;Why?&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Had I but lived a hundred years ago I might have gone, as I have gone this year, By Warmwell Cross on to a Cove I know, And Time have placed his finger on me there: &amp;quot;You see that man?&amp;quot; — I might have looked, and said, &amp;quot;O yes: I see him. One that boat has brought Which dropped down Channel round Saint Alban&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s Head. So commonplace a youth calls not my thought.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You see that man?&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;Why yes; I told you; yes: Of an idling town-sort; thin; hair brown in hue; And as the evening light scants less and less He looks up at a star, as many do.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;You see that man?&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;Nay, leave me!&amp;quot; then I plead, &amp;quot;I have fifteen miles to vamp across the lea, And it grows dark, and I am weary-kneed: I have said the third time; yes, that man I see!&amp;quot; &amp;quot;Good. That man goes to Rome — to death, despair; And no one notes him now but you and I: A hundred years, and the world will follow him there, And bend with reverence where his ashes lie.&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;(in Memoriam F. W. G.) Orion swung southward aslant Where the starved Egdon pine-trees had thinned, The Pleiads aloft seemed to pant With the heather that twitched in the wind; But he looked on indifferent to sights such as these, Unswayed by love, friendship, home joy or home sorrow, And wondered to what he would march on the morrow. The crazed household-clock with its whirr Rang midnight within as he stood, He heard the low sighing of her Who had striven from his birth for his good; But he still only asked the spring starlight, the breeze, What great thing or small thing his history would borrow From that Game with Death he would play on the morrow. When the heath wore the robe of late summer, And the fuchsia-bells, hot in the sun, Hung red by the door, a quick comer Brought tidings that marching was done For him who had joined in that game overseas Where Death stood to win, though his name was to borrow A brightness therefrom not to fade on the morrow.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;You did not come, And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb,— Yet less for loss of your dear presence there Than that I thus found lacking in your make That high compassion which can overbear Reluctance for pure lovingkindness’ sake Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum, You did not come. You love not me, And love alone can lend you loyalty; –I know and knew it. But, unto the store Of human deeds divine in all but name, Was it not worth a little hour or more To add yet this: Once you, a woman, came To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be You love not me?&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;That night your great guns, unawares, Shook all our coffins as we lay, And broke the chancel window-squares, We thought it was the Judgment-day And sat upright. While drearisome Arose the howl of wakened hounds: The mouse let fall the altar-crumb, The worms drew back into the mounds, The glebe cow drooled. Till God called, “No; It’s gunnery practice out at sea Just as before you went below; The world is as it used to be: “All nations striving strong to make Red war yet redder. Mad as hatters They do no more for Christés sake Than you who are helpless in such matters. “That this is not the judgment-hour For some of them’s a blessed thing, For if it were they’d have to scour Hell’s floor for so much threatening.... “Ha, ha. It will be warmer when I blow the trumpet (if indeed I ever do; for you are men, And rest eternal sorely need).” So down we lay again. “I wonder, Will the world ever saner be,” Said one, “than when He sent us under In our indifferent century!” And many a skeleton shook his head. “Instead of preaching forty year,” My neighbour Parson Thirdly said, “I wish I had stuck to pipes and beer.” Again the guns disturbed the hour, Roaring their readiness to avenge, As far inland as Stourton Tower, And Camelot, and starlit Stonehenge.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;“A woman for whom great gods might strive!” I said, and kissed her there: And then I thought of the other five, And of how charms outwear. I thought of the first with her eating eyes, And I thought of the second with hers, green-gray, And I thought of the third, experienced, wise, And I thought of the fourth who sang all day. And I thought of the fifth, whom I&amp;#39;d called a jade. And I thought of them all, tear-fraught; And that each had shown her a passable maid, Yet not of the favour sought. So I traced these words on the bark of a beech, Just at the falling of the mast: “After scanning five; yes, each and each, I&amp;#39;ve found the woman desired – at last!” “–I feel a strange benumbing spell, As one ill-wished!” said she. And soon it seemed that something fell Was starving her love for me. “I feel some curse. O, five were there?” And wanly she swerved, and went away. I followed sick: night numbed the air, And dark the mournful moorland lay. I cried: “O darling, turn your head!” But never her face I viewed; “O turn, O turn!” again I said, And miserably pursued. At length I came to a Christ-cross stone Which she had passed without discern; And I knelt upon the leaves there strown, And prayed aloud that she might turn. I rose, and looked; and turn she did; I cried, “My heart revives!” “Look more,” she said. I looked as bid; Her face was all the five&amp;#39;s. All the five women, clear come back, I saw in her – with her made one, The while she drooped upon the track, And her frail term seemed well-nigh run. She&amp;#39;d half forgot me in her change; “Who are you? Won&amp;#39;t you say Who you may be, you man so strange, Following since yesterday?” I took the composite form she was, And carried her to an arbour small, Not passion-moved, but even because In one I could atone to all. And there she lies, and there I tend, Till my life&amp;#39;s threads unwind, A various womanhood in blend – Not one, but all combined.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;(Lines on the loss of the &amp;quot;Titanic&amp;quot;) I In a solitude of the sea Deep from human vanity, And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she. II Steel chambers, late the pyres Of her salamandrine fires, Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres. III Over the mirrors meant To glass the opulent The sea-worm crawls — grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.

IX Alien they seemed to be; No mortal eye could see The intimate welding of their later history, X Or sign that they were bent By paths coincident On being anon twin halves of one august event, XI Till the Spinner of the Years Said &amp;quot;Now!&amp;quot; And each one hears, And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;I leant upon a coppice gate When Frost was spectre-grey, And Winter&amp;#39;s dregs made desolate The weakening eye of day. The tangled bine-stems scored the sky Like strings of broken lyres, And all mankind that haunted nigh Had sought their household fires. The land&amp;#39;s sharp features seemed to be The Century&amp;#39;s corpse outleant, His crypt the cloudy canopy, The wind his death-lament. The ancient pulse of germ and birth Was shrunken hard and dry, And every spirit upon earth Seemed fervourless as I. At once a voice arose among The bleak twigs overhead In a full-hearted evensong Of joy illimited; An aged thrush, frail, gaunt, and small, In blast-beruffled plume, Had chosen thus to fling his soul Upon the growing gloom. So little cause for carolings Of such ecstatic sound Was written on terrestrial things Afar or nigh around, That I could think there trembled through His happy good-night air Some blessed Hope, whereof he knew And I was unaware.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;They hail me as one living, But don&amp;#39;t they know That I have died of late years, Untombed although? I am but a shape that stands here, A pulseless mould, A pale past picture, screening Ashes gone cold. Not at a minute&amp;#39;s warning, Not in a loud hour, For me ceased Time&amp;#39;s enchantments In hall and bower. There was no tragic transit, No catch of breath, When silent seasons inched me On to this death .... — A Troubadour-youth I rambled With Life for lyre, The beats of being raging In me like fire. But when I practised eyeing The goal of men, It iced me, and I perished A little then. When passed my friend, my kinsfolk, Through the Last Door, And left me standing bleakly, I died yet more; And when my Love&amp;#39;s heart kindled In hate of me, Wherefore I knew not, died I One more degree. And if when I died fully I cannot say, And changed into the corpse-thing I am to-day, Yet is it that, though whiling The time somehow In walking, talking, smiling, I live not now.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;They sing their dearest songs— He, she, all of them—yea, Treble and tenor and bass, And one to play; With the candles mooning each face. . . . Ah, no; the years O! How the sick leaves reel down in throngs! They clear the creeping moss— Elders and juniors—aye, Making the pathways neat And the garden gay; And they build a shady seat. . . . Ah, no; the years, the years, See, the white storm-birds wing across. They are blithely breakfasting all— Men and maidens—yea, Under the summer tree, With a glimpse of the bay, While pet fowl come to the knee. . . . Ah, no; the years O! And the rotten rose is ript from the wall. They change to a high new house, He, she, all of them—aye, Clocks and carpets and chairs On the lawn all day, And brightest things that are theirs. . . . Ah, no; the years, the years; Down their carved names the rain-drop ploughs.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;How much shall I love her? For life, or not long? “Not long.” Alas! When forget her? In years, or by June? “By June.” And whom woo I after? No one, or a throng? “A throng.” Of these shall I wed one Long hence, or quite soon? “Quite soon.” And which will my bride be? The right or the wrong? “The wrong.” And my remedy – what kind? Wealth-wove, or earth-hewn? “Earth-hewn.”&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Autumn 1914 &amp;#39;O England, may God punish thee!&amp;#39; — Is it that Teuton genius flowers Only to breathe malignity Upon its friend of earlier hours?— We have eaten your bread, you have eaten ours, We have loved your burgs, your pines&amp;#39; green moan, Fair Rhine-stream, and its storied towers; Your shining souls of deathless dowers Have won us as they were our own: We have nursed no dreams to shed your blood, We have matched your might not rancorously Save a flushed few whose blatant mood You heard and marked as well as we To tongue not in their country&amp;#39;s key; But yet you cry with face aflame, &amp;#39;O England, may God punish thee!&amp;#39; And foul in onward history, And present sight, your ancient name.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;At last I entered a long dark gallery, Catacomb-lined; and ranged at the side Were the bodies of men from far and wide Who, motion past, were nevertheless not dead. &amp;quot;The sense of waiting here strikes strong; Everyone&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s waiting, waiting, it seems to me; What are you waiting for so long? — What is to happen?&amp;quot; I said. &amp;quot;O we are waiting for one called God,&amp;quot; said they, &amp;quot;(Though by some the Will, or Force, or Laws; And, vaguely, by some, the Ultimate Cause;) Waiting for him to see us before we are clay. Yes; waiting, waiting, for God to know it.&amp;quot; ... &amp;quot;To know what?&amp;quot; questioned I. &amp;quot;To know how things have been going on earth and below it: It is clear he must know some day.&amp;quot; I thereon asked them why. &amp;quot;Since he made us humble pioneers Of himself in consciousness of Life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s tears, It needs no mighty prophecy To tell that what he could mindlessly show His creatures, he himself will know. &amp;quot;By some still close-cowled mystery We have reached feeling faster than he, But he will overtake us anon, If the world goes on.&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;If but some vengeful god would call to me From up the sky, and laugh: “Thou suffering thing, Know that thy sorrow is my ecstasy, That thy love&amp;#39;s loss is my hate&amp;#39;s profiting!” Then would I bear it, clench myself, and die, Steeled by the sense of ire unmerited; Half-eased in that a Powerfuller than I Had willed and meted me the tears I shed. But not so. How arrives it joy lies slain, And why unblooms the best hope ever sown? —Crass Casualty obstructs the sun and rain, And dicing Time for gladness casts a moan. . . . These purblind Doomsters had as readily strown Blisses about my pilgrimage as pain.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;He does not think that I haunt here nightly: How shall I let him know That whither his fancy sets him wandering I, too, alertly go? - Hover and hover a few feet from him Just as I used to do, But cannot answer the words he lifts me – Only listen thereto! When I could answer he did not say them: When I could let him know How I would like to join in his journeys Seldom he wished to go. Now that he goes and wants me with him More than he used to do, Never he sees my faithful phantom Though he speaks thereto. Yes, I companion him to places Only dreamers know, Where the shy hares print long paces, Where the night rooks go; Into old aisles where the past is all to him, Close as his shade can do, Always lacking the power to call to him, Near as I reach thereto! What a good haunter I am, O tell him, Quickly make him know If he but sigh since my loss befell him Straight to his side I go. Tell him a faithful one is doing All that love can do Still that his path may be worth pursuing, And to bring peace thereto.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Dora’s gone to Ireland Through the sleet and snow; Promptly she has gone there In a ship, although Why she’s gone to Ireland Dora does not know. That was where, yea, Ireland, Dora wished to be: When she felt, in lone times, Shoots of misery, Often there, in Ireland, Dora wished to be. Hence she’s gone to Ireland, Since she meant to go, Through the drift and darkness Onward labouring, though That she’s gone to Ireland Dora does not know.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;I looked up from my writing, And gave a start to see, As if rapt in my inditing, The moon&amp;#39;s full gaze on me. Her meditative misty head Was spectral in its air, And I involuntarily said, &amp;#39;What are you doing there?&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Oh, I&amp;#39;ve been scanning pond and hole And waterway hereabout For the body of one with a sunken soul Who has put his life-light out. &amp;#39;Did you hear his frenzied tattle? It was sorrow for his son Who is slain in brutish battle, Though he has injured none. &amp;#39;And now I am curious to look Into the blinkered mind Of one who wants to write a book In a world of such a kind.&amp;#39; Her temper overwrought me, And I edged to shun her view, For I felt assured she thought me One who should drown him too.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;“Percussus sum sicut foenum, et aruit cor meum.” —Ps. ci. Wintertime nighs; But my bereavement-pain It cannot bring again: Twice no one dies. Flower-petals flee; But, since it once hath been, No more that severing scene Can harrow me. Birds faint in dread: I shall not lose old strength In the lone frost&amp;#39;s black length: Strength long since fled! Leaves freeze to dun; But friends can not turn cold This season as of old For him with none. Tempests may scath; But love can not make smart Again this year his heart Who no heart hath. Black is night&amp;#39;s cope; But death will not appal One who, past doubtings all, Waits in unhope.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;I Only a man harrowing clods In a slow silent walkWith an old horse that stumbles and nods Half asleep as they stalk. II Only thin smoke without flame From the heaps of couch-grass;Yet this will go onward the same Though Dynasties pass. III Yonder a maid and her wight Come whispering by:War’s annals will cloud into night Ere their story die.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;“I am playing my oldest tunes,” declared she, “All the old tunes I know,— Those I learnt ever so long ago.” —Why she should think just then she’d play them Silence cloaks like snow. When I returned from the town at nightfall Notes continued to pour As when I had left two hours before: “It’s the very last time,” she said in closing; “From now I play no more.” A few morns onward found her fading, And, as her life outflew, I thought of her playing her tunes right through; And I felt she had known of what was coming, And wondered how she knew.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;Had he and I but met By some old ancient inn, We should have sat us down to wet Right many a nipperkin! &amp;quot;But ranged as infantry, And staring face to face, I shot at him as he at me, And killed him in his place. &amp;quot;I shot him dead because — Because he was my foe, Just so: my foe of course he was; That&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s clear enough; although &amp;quot;He thought he&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;d &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;list, perhaps, Off-hand like — just as I — Was out of work — had sold his traps — No other reason why. &amp;quot;Yes; quaint and curious war is! You shoot a fellow down You&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;d treat if met where any bar is, Or help to half-a-crown.&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;I found me in a great surging space, At either end a door, And I said: &amp;quot;What is this giddying place, With no firm-fixéd floor, That I knew not of before?&amp;quot; &amp;quot;It is Life,&amp;quot; said a mask-clad face. I asked: &amp;quot;But how do I come here, Who never wished to come; Can the light and air be made more clear, The floor more quietsome, And the doors set wide? They numb Fast-locked, and fill with fear.&amp;quot; The mask put on a bleak smile then, And said, &amp;quot;O vassal-wight, There once complained a goosequill pen To the scribe of the Infinite Of the words it had to write Because they were past its ken.&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;What of the faith and fire within usMen who march awayEre the barn-cocks sayNight is growing gray,Leaving all that here can win us;What of the faith and fire within usMen who march away? Is it a purblind prank, O think you,Friend with the musing eye,Who watch us stepping byWith doubt and dolorous sigh?Can much pondering so hoodwink you!Is it a purblind prank, O think you,Friend with the musing eye? Nay. We well see what we are doing,Though some may not see—Dalliers as they be—England&amp;#39;s need are we;Her distress would leave us rueing:Nay. We well see what we are doing,Though some may not see! In our heart of hearts believingVictory crowns the just,And that braggarts mustSurely bite the dust,Press we to the field ungrieving,In our heart of hearts believingVictory crowns the just. Hence the faith and fire within usMen who march awayEre the barn-cocks sayNight is growing gray,Leaving all that here can win us;Hence the faith and fire within usMen who march away.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;We stood by a pond that winter day, And the sun was white, as though chidden of God, And a few leaves lay on the starving sod; – They had fallen from an ash, and were gray. Your eyes on me were as eyes that rove Over tedious riddles of years ago; And some words played between us to and fro On which lost the more by our love. The smile on your mouth was the deadest thing Alive enough to have strength to die; And a grin of bitterness swept thereby Like an ominous bird a-wing…. Since then, keen lessons that love deceives, And wrings with wrong, have shaped to me Your face, and the God curst sun, and a tree, And a pond edged with grayish leaves.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;1915-1916 I Phantasmal fears, And the flap of the flame, And the throb of the clock, And a loosened slate, And the blind night&amp;#39;s drone, Which tiredly the spectral pines intone! II And the blood in my ears Strumming always the same, And the gable-cock With its fitful grate, And myself, alone. III The twelfth hour nears Hand-hid, as in shame; I undo the lock, And listen, and wait For the Young Unknown. IV In the dark there careers — As if Death astride came To numb all with his knock — A horse at mad rate Over rut and stone. V No figure appears, No call of my name, No sound but &amp;#39;Tic-toc&amp;#39; Without check. Past the gate It clatters — is gone. VI What rider it bears There is none to proclaim; And the Old Year has struck, And, scarce animate, The New makes moan. VII Maybe that &amp;#39;More Tears! — More Famine and Flame — More Severance and Shock!&amp;#39; Is the order from Fate That the Rider speeds on To pale Europe; and tiredly the pines intone.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;A Load of brushes and baskets and cradles and chairs Labours along the street in the rain: With it a man, a woman, a pony with whiteybrown hairs. — The man foots in front of the horse with a shambling sway At a slower tread than a funeral train, While to a dirge-like tune he chants his wares, Swinging a Turk&amp;#39;s-head brush (in a drum-major&amp;#39;s way When the bandsmen march and play). A yard from the back of the man is the whiteybrown pony&amp;#39;s nose: He mirrors his master in every item of pace and pose: He stops when the man stops, without being told, And seems to be eased by a pause; too plainly he&amp;#39;s old, Indeed, not strength enough shows To steer the disjointed waggon straight, Which wriggles left and right in a rambling line, Deflected thus by its own warp and weight, And pushing the pony with it in each incline. The woman walks on the pavement verge, Parallel to the man: She wears an apron white and wide in span, And carries a like Turk&amp;#39;s-head, but more in nursing-wise: Now and then she joins in his dirge, But as if her thoughts were on distant things, The rain clams her apron till it clings. — So, step by step, they move with their merchandize, And nobody buys.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;October 18, 1914 I dreamt that people from the Land of Chimes Arrived one autumn morning with their bells, To hoist them on the towers and citadels Of my own country, that the musical rhymes Rung by them into space at meted times Amid the market&amp;#39;s daily stir and stress, And the night&amp;#39;s empty star-lit silentness, Might solace souls of this and kindred climes. Then I awoke; and lo, before me stood The visioned ones, but pale and full of fear; From Bruges they came, and Antwerp, and Ostend, No carillons in their train. Foes of mad mood Had shattered these to shards amid the gear Of ravaged roof, and smouldering gable-end.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Christmas Eve, and twelve of the clock.“Now they are all on their knees,”An elder said as we sat in a flockBy the embers in hearthside ease.We pictured the meek mild creatures whereThey dwelt in their strawy pen,Nor did it occur to one of us thereTo doubt they were kneeling then.So fair a fancy few would weaveIn these years! Yet, I feel,If someone said on Christmas Eve,“Come; see the oxen kneel,“In the lonely barton by yonder coombOur childhood used to know,”I should go with him in the gloom,Hoping it might be so.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;I Queer are the ways of a man I know: He comes and stands In a careworn craze, And looks at the sands And the seaward haze With moveless hands And face and gaze, Then turns to go... And what does he see when he gazes so? II They say he sees as an instant thing More clear than to-day, A sweet soft scene That once was in play By that briny green; Yes, notes alway Warm, real, and keen, What his back years bring— A phantom of his own figuring. III Of this vision of his they might say more: Not only there Does he see this sight, But everywhere In his brain–day, night, As if on the air It were drawn rose bright– Yea, far from that shore Does he carry this vision of heretofore: IV A ghost-girl-rider. And though, toil-tried, He withers daily, Time touches her not, But she still rides gaily In his rapt thought On that shagged and shaly Atlantic spot, And as when first eyed Draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;April 1915 I walked in loamy Wessex lanes, afar From rail-track and from highway, and I heard In field and farmstead many an ancient word Of local lineage like &amp;#39;Thu bist,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Er war,&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Ich woll&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;Er sholl&amp;#39;, and by-talk similar, Nigh as they speak who in this month&amp;#39;s moon gird At England&amp;#39;s very loins, thereunto spurred By gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are. Then seemed a Heart crying: &amp;#39;Whosoever they be At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame Between kin folk kin tongued even as are we, &amp;#39;Sinister, ugly, lurid, be their fame; May their familiars grow to shun their name, And their brood perish everlastingly.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Clouds spout upon her Their waters amain In ruthless disdain, – Her who but lately Had shivered with pain As at touch of dishonour If there had lit on her So coldly, so straightly Such arrows of rain: One who to shelter Her delicate head Would quicken and quicken Each tentative tread If drops chanced to pelt her That summertime spills In dust-paven rills When thunder-clouds thicken And birds close their bills. Would that I lay there And she were housed here! Or better, together Were folded away there Exposed to one weather We both, – who would stray there When sunny the day there, Or evening was clear At the prime of the year. Soon will be growing Green blades from her mound, And daisies be showing Like stars on the ground, Till she form part of them – Ay – the sweet heart of them, Loved beyond measure With a child’s pleasure All her life’s round.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;&amp;quot;O &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Melia, my dear, this does everything crown! Who could have supposed I should meet you in Town? And whence such fair garments, such prosperi-ty?&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;O didn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;t you know I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;d been ruined?&amp;quot; said she. — &amp;quot;You left us in tatters, without shoes or socks, Tired of digging potatoes, and spudding up docks; And now you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;ve gay bracelets and bright feathers three!&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;Yes: that&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s how we dress when we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;re ruined,&amp;quot; said she. — &amp;quot;At home in the barton you said thee&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; and thou,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; And thik oon,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; and theäs oon,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt; and t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;other&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;; but now Your talking quite fits &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;ee for high compa-ny!&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;Some polish is gained with one&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s ruin,&amp;quot; said she. — &amp;quot;Your hands were like paws then, your face blue and bleak But now I&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;m bewitched by your delicate cheek, And your little gloves fit as on any la-dy!&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;We never do work when we&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;re ruined,&amp;quot; said she. — &amp;quot;You used to call home-life a hag-ridden dream, And you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;d sigh, and you&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;d sock; but at present you seem To know not of megrims or melancho-ly!&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;True. One&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s pretty lively when ruined,&amp;quot; said she. — &amp;quot;I wish I had feathers, a fine sweeping gown, And a delicate face, and could strut about Town!&amp;quot; — &amp;quot;My dear — a raw country girl, such as you be, Cannot quite expect that. You ain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;t ruined,&amp;quot; said she.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;He enters, and mute on the edge of a chair Sits a thin-faced lady, a stranger there, A type of decayed gentility; And by some small signs he well can guess That she comes to him almost breakfastless. &amp;quot;I have called — I hope I do not err — I am looking for a purchaser Of some score volumes of the works Of eminent divines I own, — Left by my father — though it irks My patience to offer them.&amp;quot; And she smiles As if necessity were unknown; &amp;quot;But the truth of it is that oftenwhiles I have wished, as I am fond of art, To make my rooms a little smart, And these old books are so in the way.&amp;quot; And lightly still she laughs to him, As if to sell were a mere gay whim, And that, to be frank, Life were indeed To her not vinegar and gall, But fresh and honey-like; and Need No household skeleton at all.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Here is the ancient floor, Footworn and hollowed and thin, Here was the former door Where the dead feet walked in. She sat here in her chair, Smiling into the fire; He who played stood there, Bowing it higher and higher. Childlike, I danced in a dream; Blessings emblazoned that day; Everything glowed with a gleam; Yet we were looking away!&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;I went by the Druid stone That broods in the garden white and lone, And I stopped and looked at the shifting shadows That at some moments fall thereon From the tree hard by with a rhythmic swing, And they shaped in my imagining To the shade that a well-known head and shoulders Threw there when she was gardening. I thought her behind my back, Yea, her I long had learned to lack, And I said: ‘I am sure you are standing behind me, Though how do you get into this old track?’ And there was no sound but the fall of a leaf As a sad response; and to keep down grief I would not turn my head to discover That there was nothing in my belief. Yet I wanted to look and see That nobody stood at the back of me; But I thought once more: ‘Nay, I’ll not unvision A shape which, somehow, there may be.’ So I went on softly from the glade, And left her behind me throwing her shade, As she were indeed an apparition— My head unturned lest my dream should fade.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;I I heard a small sad sound, And stood awhile among the tombs around: &amp;quot;Wherefore, old friends,&amp;quot; said I, &amp;quot;are you distrest, Now, screened from life&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s unrest?&amp;quot; II —&amp;quot;O not at being here; But that our future second death is near; When, with the living, memory of us numbs, And blank oblivion comes! III &amp;quot;These, our sped ancestry, Lie here embraced by deeper death than we; Nor shape nor thought of theirs can you descry With keenest backward eye. IV &amp;quot;They count as quite forgot; They are as men who have existed not; Theirs is a loss past loss of fitful breath; It is the second death. V &amp;quot;We here, as yet, each day Are blest with dear recall; as yet, can say We hold in some soul loved continuance Of shape and voice and glance. VI &amp;quot;But what has been will be — First memory, then oblivion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s swallowing sea; Like men foregone, shall we merge into those Whose story no one knows. VII &amp;quot;For which of us could hope To show in life that world-awakening scope Granted the few whose memory none lets die, But all men magnify? VIII &amp;quot;We were but Fortune&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;s sport; Things true, things lovely, things of good report We neither shunned nor sought ... We see our bourne, And seeing it we mourn.&amp;quot;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
 &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Woman much missed, how you call to me, call to me, Saying that now you are not as you were When you had changed from the one who was all to me, But as at first, when our day was fair. Can it be you that I hear? Let me view you, then, Standing as when I drew near to the town Where you would wait for me: yes, as I knew you then, Even to the original air-blue gown! Or is it only the breeze, in its listlessness Travelling across the wet mead to me here, You being ever dissolved to wan wistlessness, Heard no more again far or near? Thus I; faltering forward, Leaves around me falling, Wind oozing thin through the thorn from norward, And the woman calling.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hardy_poems&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The three dataframes will now be combined into one using the concatenate function in Pandas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;df&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;concat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;milton&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;wordsworth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;axis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ignore_index&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;It's now time to prepare the dataframe mapper and classification model for our pipeline. I begin by defining my X and y values, as well as performing a test train split with a test size of 40% and a random state of FiveThirtyEight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;poems&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;final&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;author&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;X_train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;X_test&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y_train&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y_test&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;train_test_split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;X&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;test_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;random_state&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;538&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Below is a custom fuction that will take in each poem as an input, and perform serveral operations on top of it. This process with convert all text to lower case, tokenize the words in each poem, remove the stopwords, stem the remaining words, and eventually put the words back together into a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;poem_to_tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;lower_case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;retokenizer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;RegexpTokenizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sa"&gt;r&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;\w+&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;retokenizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;tokenize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lower_case&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;stops&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stopwords&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;english&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;meaningful_words&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;words&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;not&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;stops&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;stemmer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;PorterStemmer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;stemmed_words&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stemmer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;w&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;meaningful_words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot; &amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;join&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;stemmed_words&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I'll be using Logistic Regression for this classification task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LogisticRegression&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The mapper will perform the previously defined poem_to_tokens function on top of each poem in the dataframe, and then the CountVectorizer in addition.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;DataFrameMapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;poems&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FunctionTransformer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;poem_to_tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;CountVectorizer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;df_out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I will now feed the model and mapper I have defined into a pipeline, and then fit and score my model. This will tell me exactly how accurate my classification model is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;make_pipeline&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mapper&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;model&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It appears the accuracy score is quite respectable. Not quite where I'd like it to be, but not terrible for a first attempt. Finally, I will create a new dataframe with just one entry to predict the author of the poem that's being fed into the model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will be using Song on May Morning by John Milton.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DataFrame&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;({&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;poems&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;NOW the bright morning-star, Day’s harbinger, Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her The flowery May, who from her green lap throws The yellow cowslip and the pale primrose. Hail, bounteous May, that dost inspire Mirth, and youth, and warm desire! Woods and groves are of thy dressing; Hill and dale doth boast thy blessing. Thus we salute thee with our early song, And welcome thee, and wish thee long.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pipe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;predict&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;array([&amp;#39;Milton&amp;#39;], dtype=object)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Not too shabby, but the model could certainly use more complexity and nuance. So that was a basic NLP classification model that accepts a poem, and hopefully returns the name of its author.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Renewable Energy and Ugly Data</title><link href="https://amanchl.github.io/blog/blog3.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-01-04T11:10:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-01-04T11:10:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Aman Chahal</name></author><id>tag:amanchl.github.io,2020-01-04:/blog/blog3.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h1&gt;Renewable Energy and Ugly Data&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to prepare the dataframe for a stacked bar chart, it is first necessary to melt the year columns all into one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sea&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;melt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;id_vars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Country&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value_vars&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2015&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2016&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2017&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2018&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;2019&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;var_name&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Year&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;value_name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Capacity&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div&gt;
&lt;style scoped&gt;
    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {

      &lt;td&gt;2015&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0.7&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Malaysia&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2015&lt;/td&gt;

    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below, we will spin up a stacked bar chart in Altair depicting the construction of new coal power generators in the South East Asian countries of Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Phillippines, Thailand, and Vietnam by year between 2015 and the first half of 2019.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To make things neater, it's probably a good idea to remove the grid as well as unnecessary broders around the chart. Aditionally, the choice of colors for each country in the original chart is both confusing and unattractive, so we will change that up a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we're going to rescale the X-axis to the range of 0-15 so as to accurately depict the data, as well as simplify the X ticks in order to further reduce the clutter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The legend seems a tad small in comparison to the chart so that's going to need some tweaking as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, using tooltip, we'll add an interactive element to the chart wherein, simply by hovering your mouse pointer over an area of any bar, you will be able to see the corresponding country and its projected additional coal power generation capacity for that year.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;alt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Chart&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;width&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;800&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;height&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;New Coal Generator (in Megawatts) Construction in South East Asia By Year&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mark_bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;encode&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Data visualization is a keystone of data science, and can serve as a powerful tool to communicate findings and insights in a digestible manner to the layperson. It can also help data scientists to uncover hidden and less obvious patterns and insight through exploratory analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Matplotlib library is the popular choice for presentation, in large part due to its customizability, Seaborn is perhaps a more suitable tool for quick exploratory analysis owing to its quick and nimble nature. Simple plots can be drawn up with one mere line of code, which frees up time and effort to divert cognitive resources to more pressing matters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's explore one of the most popular datasets--Titanic--to explore the capabilities of Seaborn.
We begin by importing all the requisite libraries to import and parse the dataset, as well as draw up a handful of seaborn plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pandas&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;seaborn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;pd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;read_csv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;train.csv&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Let's take a quick look at the columns and the first ten rows of the dataset.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;head&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;349909&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;21.0750&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;S&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;8&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Johnson, Mrs. Oscar W (Elisabeth Vilhelmina Berg)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;female&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;27.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;347742&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;11.1333&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;S&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;9&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Nasser, Mrs. Nicholas (Adele Achem)&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;female&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;14.0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;0&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;237736&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;30.0708&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;NaN&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;C&lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A simple pairplot would deliver plotwise relationships between relevant columns in the dataset for a quick initial look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pairplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/EUdU9tW.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we will draw up a heatmap to better undsersand the intensity of correlation between the various variables. We will set annotations to True in order to better understand these correlations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;heatmap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;corr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;annot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/DEBzXfX.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There seems to be a faintly positive relationship between the ticket fare and survival rates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we will explore the age distribution using the distplot. In order to do that, we'll first drop all the values in the age column with NaN values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dropna&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Age&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;distplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Age&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;bins&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/WJcIjLc.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It appears the majority of passengers were between 20 and 30 years of age, with the number of passengers in subsequent age brackets dropping progressively.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let us now explore the ticket fare range for each passenger class using a boxplot. To make things easier to interpret, we will also increase the size of the figure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;boxplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Pclass&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Fare&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;figure.figsize&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;17&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)})&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/eD0jIPf.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Passenger class 1, to no one's surprise, has the highest and widest range of prices. A peculiar addition to that obvious finding would be a ticket that appears to have cost over $500. Let's see if we can find out someone who belongs to the early 20th century 1% club.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Name&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Fare&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;258                      Ward, Miss. Anna
679    Cardeza, Mr. Thomas Drake Martinez
737                Lesurer, Mr. Gustave J
Name: Name, dtype: object
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As it turns out, it's not just one, but three people who hold the priciest ticket of the ship. I wonder if they made it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Survived&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;][&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Fare&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;500&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;258    1
679    1
737    1
Name: Survived, dtype: int64
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Of course they did. $500 tickets come with their own perks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can do some further exploratory analysis with a factorplot to extract the average age of men and women who survived and thsoe who did not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;factorplot&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Survived&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Age&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;Sex&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;titanic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;kind&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;bar&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://i.imgur.com/GzhaWBy.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those that did not make it, men tended to be, on average, older than the women. For those that survived, men, on average, were younger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are just some of the countless ways seaborn can be used to conjure up exploratory visuals with minimal code. While this might not be the most suitable solution for more complex visualizations for presentation purposes, it's a nifty little tool to get started on some data-oriented detective work with such little effort.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>My First Blog Post!</title><link href="https://amanchl.github.io/blog/blog1.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-12T10:30:00-04:00</published><updated>2019-09-12T10:30:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Aman Chahal</name></author><id>tag:amanchl.github.io,2019-09-12:/blog/blog1.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua.
